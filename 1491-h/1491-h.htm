<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sixteen</span> of these Letters, which
were written at the suggestion of the Editor of the &ldquo;St.
James&rsquo;s Gazette,&rdquo; appeared in that journal, from
which they are now reprinted, by the Editor&rsquo;s kind
permission.&nbsp; They have been somewhat emended, and a few
additions have been made.&nbsp; The Letters to Horace, Byron,
Isaak Walton, Chapelain, Ronsard, and Theocritus have not been
published before.</p>
<p>The gem on the title-page, now engraved for the first time, is
a red cornelian in the British Museum, probably
Gr&aelig;co-Roman, and treated in an archaistic style.&nbsp; It
represents Hermes Psychagogos, with a Soul, and has some likeness
to the Baptism of Our Lord, as usually shown in art.&nbsp;
Perhaps it may be post-Christian.&nbsp; The gem was selected by
Mr. A. S. Murray.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, superfluous to add that some of the Letters
are written rather to suit the Correspondent than to express the
writer&rsquo;s own taste or opinions.&nbsp; The Epistle to Lord
Byron, especially, is &ldquo;writ in a manner which is my
aversion.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I.<br />
<i>To W. M. Thackeray</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;There are many things
that stand in the way of the critic when he has a mind to praise
the living.&nbsp; He may dread the charge of writing rather to
vex a rival than to exalt the subject of his applause.&nbsp; He
shuns the appearance of seeking the favour of the famous, and
would not willingly be regarded as one of the many parasites who
now advertise each movement and action of contemporary
genius.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such and such men of letters are passing
their summer holidays in the Val d&rsquo;Aosta,&rdquo; or the
Mountains of the Moon, or the Suliman Range, as it may
happen.&nbsp; So reports our literary &ldquo;Court
Circular,&rdquo; and all our <i>Pr&eacute;cieuses</i> read the
tidings with enthusiasm.&nbsp; Lastly, if the critic be quite new
to the world of letters, he may superfluously fear to vex a poet
or a novelist by the abundance of his eulogy.&nbsp; No such
doubts perplex us when, with all our hearts, we would commend the
departed; for they have passed almost beyond the reach even of
envy; and to those pale cheeks of theirs no commendation can
bring the red.</p>
<p>You, above all others, were and remain without a rival in your
many-sided excellence, and praise of you strikes at none of those
who have survived your day.&nbsp; The increase of time only
mellows your renown, and each year that passes and brings you no
successor does but sharpen the keenness of our sense of
loss.&nbsp; In what other novelist, since Scott was worn down by
the burden of a forlorn endeavour, and died for honour&rsquo;s
sake, has the world found so many of the fairest gifts
combined?&nbsp; If we may not call you a poet (for the first of
English writers of light verse did not seek that crown), who that
was less than a poet ever saw life with a glance so keen as
yours, so steady, and so sane?&nbsp; Your pathos was never cheap,
your laughter never forced; your sigh was never the pulpit trick
of the preacher.&nbsp; Your funny people&mdash;your Costigans and
Fokers&mdash;were not mere characters of trick and catch-word,
were not empty comic masks.&nbsp; Behind each the human heart was
beating; and ever and again we were allowed to see the features
of the man.</p>
<p>Thus fiction in your hands was not simply a profession, like
another, but a constant reflection of the whole surface of life:
a repeated echo of its laughter and its complaint.&nbsp; Others
have written, and not written badly, with the stolid professional
regularity of the clerk at his desk; you, like the Scholar Gipsy,
might have said that &ldquo;it needs heaven-sent moments for this
skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are, it will not surprise you, some
honourable women and a few men who call you a cynic; who speak of
&ldquo;the withered world of Thackerayan satire;&rdquo; who think
your eyes were ever turned to the sordid aspects of life&mdash;to
the mother-in-law who threatens to &ldquo;take away her silver
bread-basket;&rdquo; to the intriguer, the sneak, the termagant;
to the Beckys, and Barnes Newcomes, and Mrs. Mackenzies of this
world.&nbsp; The quarrel of these sentimentalists is really with
life, not with you; they might as wisely blame Monsieur Buffon
because there are snakes in his Natural History.&nbsp; Had you
not impaled certain noxious human insects, you would have better
pleased Mr. Ruskin; had you confined yourself to such
performances, you would have been more dear to the Neo-Balzacian
school in fiction.</p>
<p>You are accused of never having drawn a good woman who was not
a doll, but the ladies that bring this charge seldom remind us
either of Lady Castlewood or of Theo or Hetty Lambert.&nbsp; The
best women can pardon you Becky Sharp and Blanche Amory; they
find it harder to forgive you Emmy Sedley and Helen
Pendennis.&nbsp; Yet what man does not know in his heart that the
best women&mdash;God bless them&mdash;lean, in their characters,
either to the sweet passiveness of Emmy or to the sensitive and
jealous affections of Helen?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Heaven, not you,
that made them so; and they are easily pardoned, both for being a
very little lower than the angels and for their gentle ambition
to be painted, as by Guido or Guercino, with wings and harps and
haloes.&nbsp; So ladies have occasionally seen their own faces in
the glass of fancy, and, thus inspired, have drawn Romola and
Consuelo.&nbsp; Yet when these fair idealists, Mdme. Sand and
George Eliot, designed Rosamund Vincy and Horace, was there not a
spice of malice in the portraits which we miss in your least
favourable studies?</p>
<p>That the creator of Colonel Newcome and of Henry Esmond was a
snarling cynic; that he who designed Rachel Esmond could not draw
a good woman: these are the chief charges (all indifferent now to
you, who were once so sensitive) that your admirers have to
contend against.&nbsp; A French critic, M. Taine, also protests
that you do preach too much.&nbsp; Did any author but yourself so
frequently break the thread (seldom a strong thread) of his plot
to converse with his reader and moralise his tale, we also might
be offended.&nbsp; But who that loves Montaigne and Pascal, who
that likes the wise trifling of the one and can bear with the
melancholy of the other, but prefers your preaching to
another&rsquo;s playing!</p>
<p>Your thoughts come in, like the intervention of the Greek
Chorus, as an ornament and source of fresh delight.&nbsp; Like
the songs of the Chorus, they bid us pause a moment over the
wider laws and actions of human fate and human life, and we turn
from your persons to yourself, and again from yourself to your
persons, as from the odes of Sophocles or Aristophanes to the
action of their characters on the stage.&nbsp; Nor, to my taste,
does the mere music and melancholy dignity of your style in these
passages of meditation fall far below the highest efforts of
poetry.&nbsp; I remember that scene where Clive, at Barnes
Newcome&rsquo;s Lecture on the Poetry of the Affections, sees
Ethel who is lost to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the past and its dear
histories, and youth and its hopes and passions, and tones and
looks for ever echoing in the heart and present in the
memory&mdash;these, no doubt, poor Clive saw and heard as he
looked across the great gulf of time, and parting and grief, and
beheld the woman he had loved for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>For ever echoing in the heart and present in the
memory</i>: who has not heard these tones, who does not hear them
as he turns over your books that, for so many years, have been
his companions and comforters?&nbsp; We have been young and old,
we have been sad and merry with you, we have listened to the
midnight chimes with Pen and Warrington, have stood with you
beside the death-bed, have mourned at that yet more awful funeral
of lost love, and with you have prayed in the inmost chapel
sacred to our old and immortal affections, <i>&agrave;
l&eacute;al souvenir</i>!&nbsp; And whenever you speak for
yourself, and speak in earnest, how magical, how rare, how lonely
in our literature is the beauty of your sentences!&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t express the charm of them&rdquo; (so you write of
George Sand; so we may write of you): &ldquo;they seem to me like
the sound of country bells, provoking I don&rsquo;t know what
vein of music and meditation, and falling sweetly and sadly on
the ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely that style, so fresh, so rich, so
full of surprises&mdash;that style which stamps as classical your
fragments of slang, and perpetually astonishes and
delights&mdash;would alone give immortality to an author, even
had he little to say.&nbsp; But you, with your whole wide world
of fops and fools, of good women and brave men, of honest
absurdities and cheery adventurers: you who created the Steynes
and Newcomes, the Beckys and Blanches, Captain Costigan and F.
B., and the Chevalier Strong&mdash;all that host of friends
imperishable&mdash;you must survive with Shakespeare and
Cervantes in the memory and affection of men.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>II.<br
/>
<i>To Charles Dickens</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It has been said that
every man is born a Platonist or an Aristotelian, though the
enormous majority of us, to be sure, live and die without being
conscious of any invidious philosophic partiality whatever.&nbsp;
With more truth (though that does not imply very much) every
Englishman who reads may be said to be a partisan of yourself or
of Mr. Thackeray.&nbsp; Why should there be any partisanship in
the matter; and why, having two such good things as your novels
and those of your contemporary, should we not be silently happy
in the possession?&nbsp; Well, men are made so, and must needs
fight and argue over their tastes in enjoyment.&nbsp; For myself,
I may say that in this matter I am what the Americans do
<i>not</i> call a &ldquo;Mugwump,&rdquo; what English politicians
dub a &ldquo;superior person&rdquo;&mdash;that is, I take no
side, and attempt to enjoy the best of both.</p>
<p>It must be owned that this attitude is sometimes made a little
difficult by the vigour of your special devotees.&nbsp; They have
ceased, indeed, thank Heaven! to imitate you; and even in
&ldquo;descriptive articles&rdquo; the touch of Mr. Gigadibs, of
him whom &ldquo;we almost took for the true Dickens,&rdquo; has
disappeared.&nbsp; The young lions of the Press no longer mimic
your less admirable mannerisms&mdash;do not strain so much after
fantastic comparisons, do not (in your manner and Mr.
Carlyle&rsquo;s) give people nick-names derived from their teeth,
or their complexion; and, generally, we are spared second-hand
copies of all that in your style was least to be commended.&nbsp;
But, though improved by lapse of time in this respect, your
devotees still put on little conscious airs of virtue, robust
manliness, and so forth, which would have irritated you very
much, and there survive some press men who seem to have read you
a little (especially your later works), and never to have read
anything else.&nbsp; Now familiarity with the pages of &ldquo;Our
Mutual Friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo; does not
precisely constitute a liberal education, and the assumption that
it does is apt (quite unreasonably) to prejudice people against
the greatest comic genius of modern times.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Time is at last beginning to sift the true
admirers of Dickens from the false.&nbsp; Yours, Sir, in the best
sense of the word, is a popular success, a popular
reputation.&nbsp; For example, I know that, in a remote and even
Pictish part of this kingdom, a rural household, humble and under
the shadow of a sorrow inevitably approaching, has found in
&ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; oblivion of winter, of sorrow,
and of sickness.&nbsp; On the other hand, people are now picking
up heart to say that &ldquo;they cannot read Dickens,&rdquo; and
that they particularly detest &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
believe it was young ladies who first had the courage of their
convictions in this respect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tout sied aux
belles,&rdquo; and the fair, in the confidence of youth, often
venture on remarkable confessions.&nbsp; In your &ldquo;Natural
History of Young Ladies&rdquo; I do not remember that you
describe the Humorous Young Lady. <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; She is a very
rare bird indeed, and humour generally is at a deplorably low
level in England.</p>
<p>Hence come all sorts of mischief, arisen since you left us;
and it may be said that inordinate philanthropy, genteel sympathy
with Irish murder and arson, Societies for Badgering the Poor,
Esoteric Buddhism, and a score of other plagues, including what
was once called &AElig;stheticism, are all, primarily, due to
want of humour.&nbsp; People discuss, with the gravest faces,
matters which properly should only be stated as the wildest
paradoxes.&nbsp; It naturally follows that, in a period almost
destitute of humour, many respectable persons &ldquo;cannot read
Dickens,&rdquo; and are not ashamed to glory in their
shame.&nbsp; We ought not to be angry with others for their
misfortunes; and yet when one meets the <i>cr&eacute;tins</i> who
boast that they cannot read Dickens, one certainly does feel much
as Mr. Samuel Weller felt when he encountered Mr. Job
Trotter.</p>
<p>How very singular has been the history of the decline of
humour!&nbsp; Is there any profound psychological truth to be
gathered from consideration of the fact that humour has gone out
with cruelty?&nbsp; A hundred years ago, eighty years
ago&mdash;nay, fifty years ago&mdash;we were a cruel but also a
humorous people.&nbsp; We had bull-baitings, and badger-drawings,
and hustings, and prize-fights, and cock-fights; we went to see
men hanged; the pillory and the stocks were no empty
&ldquo;terrors unto evil-doers,&rdquo; for there was commonly a
malefactor occupying each of these institutions.&nbsp; With all
this we had a broad-blown comic sense.&nbsp; We had Hogarth, and
Bunbury, and George Cruikshank, and Gilray; we had Leech and
Surtees, and the creator of Tittlebat Titmouse; we had the
Shepherd of the &ldquo;Noctes,&rdquo; and, above all, we had
<i>you</i>.</p>
<p>From the old giants of English fun&mdash;burly persons
delighting in broad caricature, in decided colours, in cockney
jokes, in swashing blows at the more prominent and obvious human
follies&mdash;from these you derived the splendid high spirits
and unhesitating mirth of your earlier works.&nbsp; Mr. Squeers,
and Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp, and all the Pickwickians, and Mr.
Dowler, and John Browdie&mdash;these and their immortal
companions were reared, so to speak, on the beef and beer of that
naughty, fox-hunting, badger-baiting old England, which we have
improved out of existence.&nbsp; And these characters, assuredly,
are your best; by them, though stupid people cannot read about
them, you will live while there is a laugh left among us.&nbsp;
Perhaps that does not assure you a very prolonged existence, but
only the future can show.</p>
<p>The dismal seriousness of the time cannot, let us hope, last
for ever and a day.&nbsp; Honest old Laughter, the true
<i>lutin</i> of your inspiration, must have life left in him yet,
and cannot die; though it is true that the taste for your pathos,
and your melodrama, and plots constructed after your favourite
fashion (&ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Tale of
Two Cities&rdquo; are exceptions) may go by and never be
regretted.&nbsp; Were people simpler, or only less clear-sighted,
as far as your pathos is concerned, a generation ago?&nbsp;
Jeffrey, the hard-headed shallow critic, who declared that
Wordsworth &ldquo;would never do,&rdquo; cried, &ldquo;wept like
anything,&rdquo; over your Little Nell.&nbsp; One still laughs as
heartily as ever with Dick Swiveller; but who can cry over Little
Nell?</p>
<p>Ah, Sir, how could you&mdash;who knew so intimately, who
remembered so strangely well the fancies, the dreams, the
sufferings of childhood&mdash;how could you &ldquo;wallow naked
in the pathetic,&rdquo; and massacre holocausts of the
Innocents?&nbsp; To draw tears by gloating over a child&rsquo;s
death-bed, was it worthy of you?&nbsp; Was it the kind of work
over which our hearts should melt?&nbsp; I confess that Little
Nell might die a dozen times, and be welcomed by whole legions of
Angels, and I (like the bereaved fowl mentioned by Pet Marjory)
would remain unmoved.</p>
<blockquote><p>She was more than usual calm,<br />
She did not give a single dam,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wrote the astonishing child who diverted the leisure of
Scott.&nbsp; Over your Little Nell and your Little Dombey I
remain more than usual calm; and probably so do thousands of your
most sincere admirers.&nbsp; But about matter of this kind, and
the unseating of the fountains of tears, who can argue?&nbsp;
Where is taste? where is truth?&nbsp; What tears are
&ldquo;manly, Sir, manly,&rdquo; as Fred Bayham has it; and of
what lamentations ought we rather to be ashamed?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Sunt lacrym&aelig; rerum</i>; one has been moved in the cell
where Socrates tasted the hemlock; or by the river-banks where
Syracusan arrows slew the parched Athenians among the mire and
blood; or, in fiction, when Colonel Newcome says <i>Adsum</i>, or
over the diary of Clare Doria Forey, or where Aramis laments,
with strange tears, the death of Porthos.&nbsp; But over Dombey
(the Son), or Little Nell, one declines to snivel.</p>
<p>When an author deliberately sits down and says, &ldquo;Now,
let us have a good cry,&rdquo; he poisons the wells of
sensibility and chokes, at least in many breasts, the fountain of
tears.&nbsp; Out of &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo; there is little
we care to remember except the deathless Mr. Toots; just as we
forget the melodramatics of &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have read in that book a score of
times; I never see it but I revel in it&mdash;in Pecksniff, and
Mrs. Gamp, and the Americans.&nbsp; But what the plot is all
about, what Jonas did, what Montagu Tigg had to make in the
matter, what all the pictures with plenty of shading illustrate,
I have never been able to comprehend.&nbsp; In the same way, one
of your most thorough-going admirers has allowed (in the licence
of private conversation) that &ldquo;Ralph Nickleby and Monk are
too steep;&rdquo; and probably a cultivated taste will always
find them a little precipitous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too steep:&rdquo;&mdash;the slang expresses that defect
of an ardent genius, carried above itself, and out of the air we
breathe, both in its grotesque and in its gloomy
imaginations.&nbsp; To force the note, to press fantasy too hard,
to deepen the gloom with black over the indigo, that was the
failing which proved you mortal.&nbsp; To take an instance in
little: when Pip went to Mr. Pumblechook&rsquo;s, the boy thought
the seedsman &ldquo;a very happy man to have so many little
drawers in his shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reflection is thoroughly
boyish; but then you add, &ldquo;I wondered whether the
flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of
those jails and bloom.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is not boyish at all;
that is the hard-driven, jaded literary fancy at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we arraign her; but she,&rdquo; the Genius of
Charles Dickens, how brilliant, how kindly, how beneficent she
is! dwelling by a fountain of laughter imperishable; though there
is something of an alien salt in the neighbouring fountain of
tears.&nbsp; How poor the world of fancy would be, how
&ldquo;dispeopled of her dreams,&rdquo; if, in some ruin of the
social system, the books of Dickens were lost; and if The Dodger,
and Charley Bates, and Mr. Crinkle, and Miss Squeers and Sam
Weller, and Mrs. Gamp, and Dick Swiveller were to perish, or to
vanish with Menander&rsquo;s men and women!&nbsp; We cannot think
of our world without them; and, children of dreams as they are,
they seem more essential than great statesmen, artists, soldiers,
who have actually worn flesh and blood, ribbons and orders, gowns
and uniforms.&nbsp; May we not almost welcome &ldquo;Free
Education&rdquo;? for every Englishman who can read, unless he be
an Ass, is a reader the more for you.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;Alas, how strangely are we tempered, and how strong
is the national bias!&nbsp; I have been saying things of you that
I would not hear an enemy say.&nbsp; When I read, in the
criticism of an American novelist, about your &ldquo;hysterical
emotionality&rdquo; (for he writes in American), and your
&ldquo;waste of verbiage,&rdquo; I am almost tempted to deny that
our Dickens has a single fault, to deem you impeccable!</p>

22</span>III.<br />
<i>To Pierre de Ronsard</i><br />
(<span class="GutSmall">PRINCE OF POETS</span>)</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Master And Prince of
Poets</span>,&mdash;As we know what choice thou madest of a
sepulchre (a choice how ill fulfilled by the jealousy of Fate),
so we know well the manner of thy chosen immortality.&nbsp; In
the Plains Elysian, among the heroes and the ladies of old song,
there was thy Love with thee to enjoy her paradise in an eternal
spring.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>L&agrave; du plaisant Avril la saison
immortelle</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sans eschange le suit</i>,<br />
<i>La terre sans labour, de sa grasse mamelle</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Toute chose y produit</i>;<br />
<i>D&rsquo;enbas la troupe sainte autrefois amoureuse</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Nous honorant sur tous</i>,<br />
<i>Viendra nous saluer, s&rsquo;estimant bien-heureuse</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>De s&rsquo;accointer de nous</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There thou dwellest, with the learned lovers of old days, with
Belleau, and Du Bellay, and Ba&iuml;f, and the flower of the
maidens of Anjou.&nbsp; Surely no rumour reaches thee, in that
happy place of reconciled affections, no rumour of the rudeness
of Time, the despite of men, and the change which stole from thy
locks, so early grey, the crown of laurels and of thine own
roses.&nbsp; How different from thy choice of a sepulchre have
been the fortunes of thy tomb!</p>
<blockquote><p>I will that none should break<br />
The marble for my sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishful to make more fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sepulchre!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So didst thou sing, or so thy sweet numbers run in my rude
English.&nbsp; Wearied of Courts and of priories, thou didst
desire a grave beside thine own Loire, not remote from</p>
<blockquote><p>The caves, the founts that fall<br />
From the high mountain wall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fall and flash and fleet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With silver feet.</p>
<p>Only a laurel tree<br />
Shall guard the grave of me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Apollo&rsquo;s bough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall shade me now!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Far other has been thy sepulchre: not in the free air, among
the field flowers, but in thy priory of Saint Cosme, with marble
for a monument, and no green grass to cover thee.&nbsp; Restless
wert thou in thy life; thy dust was not to be restful in thy
death.&nbsp; The Huguenots, <i>ces nouveaux Chr&eacute;tiens qui
la France ont pill&eacute;e</i>, destroyed thy tomb, and the
warning of the later monument,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ABI, NEFASTE, QUAM CALCUS HUMUM SACRA
EST,</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>has not scared away malicious men.&nbsp; The storm that passed
over France a hundred years ago, more terrible than the religious
wars that thou didst weep for, has swept the column from the
tomb.&nbsp; The marble was broken by violent hands, and the
shattered sepulchre of the Prince of Poets gained a dusty
hospitality from the museum of a country town.&nbsp; Better had
been the laurel of thy desire, the creeping vine, and the ivy
tree.</p>
<p>Scarce more fortunate, for long, than thy monument was thy
memory.&nbsp; Thou hast not encountered, Master, in the Paradise
of Poets, Messieurs Malherbe, De Balzac, and
Boileau&mdash;Boileau who spoke of thee as <i>Ce po&egrave;te
orgueilleux tr&eacute;buch&eacute; de si haut</i>!</p>
<p>These gallant gentlemen, I make no doubt, are happy after
their own fashion, backbiting each other and thee in the Paradise
of Critics.&nbsp; In their time they wrought thee much evil,
grumbling that thou wrotest in Greek and Latin (of which tongues
certain of them had but little skill), and blaming thy many lyric
melodies and the free flow of thy lines.&nbsp; What said M. de
Balzac to M. Chapelain?&nbsp; &ldquo;M. de Malherbe, M. de
Grasse, and yourself must be very little poets, if Ronsard be a
great one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Time has brought in his revenges, and
Messieurs Chapelain and De Grasse are as well forgotten as thou
art well remembered.&nbsp; Men could not always be deaf to thy
sweet old songs, nor blind to the beauty of thy roses and thy
loves.&nbsp; When they took the wax out of their ears that M.
Boileau had given them lest they should hear the singing of thy
Sirens, then they were deaf no longer, then they heard the old
deaf poet singing and made answer to his lays.&nbsp; Hast thou
not heard these sounds? have they not reached thee, the voices
and the lyres of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and Alfred de
Musset?&nbsp; Methinks thou hast marked them, and been glad that
the old notes were ringing again and the old French lyric
measures tripping to thine ancient harmonies, echoing and
replying to the Muses of Horace and Catullus.&nbsp; Returning to
Nature, poets returned to thee.&nbsp; Thy monument has perished,
but not thy music, and the Prince of Poets has returned to his
own again in a glorious Restoration.</p>
<p>Through the dust and smoke of ages, and through the centuries
of wars we strain our eyes and try to gain a glimpse of thee,
Master, in thy good days, when the Muses walked with thee.&nbsp;
We seem to mark thee wandering silent through some little
village, or dreaming in the woods, or loitering among thy lonely
places, or in gardens where the roses blossom among wilder
flowers, or on river banks where the whispering poplars and
sighing reeds make answer to the murmur of the waters.&nbsp; Such
a picture hast thou drawn of thyself in the summer
afternoons.</p>
<blockquote><p>Je m&rsquo;en vais pourmener tantost parmy la
plaine,<br />
Tantost en un village, et tantost en un bois,<br />
Et tantost par les lieux solitaires et cois.<br />
J&rsquo;aime fort les jardins qui sentent le sauvage,<br />
J&rsquo;aime le flot de l&rsquo;eau qui gazo&uuml;ille au
rivage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, methinks, there was a book in the hand of the grave and
learned poet; still thou wouldst carry thy Horace, thy Catullus,
thy Theocritus, through the gem-like weather of the
<i>Renouveau</i>, when the woods were enamelled with flowers, and
the young Spring was lodged, like a wandering prince, in his
great palaces hung with green:</p>
<blockquote><p>Orgueilleux de ses fleurs, enfl&eacute; de sa
jeunesse,<br />
Log&eacute; comme un grand Prince en ses vertes maisons!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thou sawest, in these woods by Loire side, the fair shapes of
old religion, Fauns, Nymphs, and Satyrs, and heard&rsquo;st in
the nightingale&rsquo;s music the plaint of Philomel.&nbsp; The
ancient poets came back in the train of thyself and of the
Spring, and learning was scarce less dear to thee than love; and
thy ladies seemed fairer for the names they borrowed from the
beauties of forgotten days, Helen and Cassandra.&nbsp; How
sweetly didst thou sing to them thine old morality, and how
gravely didst thou teach the lesson of the Roses!&nbsp; Well
didst thou know it, well didst thou love the Rose, since thy
nurse, carrying thee, an infant, to the holy font, let fall on
thee the sacred water brimmed with floating blossoms of the
Rose!</p>
<blockquote><p>Mignonne, allons voir si la Rose,<br />
Qui ce matin avoit desclose<br />
Sa robe de pourpre au soleil,<br />
A point perdu ceste vespree<br />
Les plis de sa robe pourpree,<br />
Et son teint au votre pareil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again,</p>
<blockquote><p>La belle Rose du Printemps,<br />
Aubert, admoneste les hommes<br />
Passer joyeusement le temps,<br />
Et pendant que jeunes nous sommes,<br />
Esbattre la fleur de nos ans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same mood, looking far down the future, thou sangest of
thy lady&rsquo;s age, the most sad, the most beautiful of thy sad
and beautiful lays; for if thy bees gathered much honey
&rsquo;twas somewhat bitter to taste, like that of the Sardinian
yews.&nbsp; How clearly we see the great hall, the grey lady
spinning and humming among her drowsy maids, and how they waken
at the word, and she sees her spring in their eyes, and they
forecast their winter in her face, when she murmurs
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Ronsard sang of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winter, and summer, and spring, how swiftly they pass, and how
early time brought thee his sorrows, and grief cast her dust upon
thy head.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adieu ma Lyre, adieu fillettes,<br />
Jadis mes douces amourettes,<br />
Adieu, je sens venir ma fin,<br />
Nul passetemps de ma jeunesse<br />
Ne m&rsquo;accompagne en la vieillesse,<br />
Que le feu, le lict et le vin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wine, and a soft bed, and a bright fire: to this trinity of
poor pleasures we come soon, if, indeed, wine be left to
us.&nbsp; Poetry herself deserts us; is it not said that Bacchus
never forgives a renegade? and most of us turn recreants to
Bacchus.&nbsp; Even the bright fire, I fear, was not always there
to warm thine old blood, Master, or, if fire there were, the wood
was not bought with thy book-seller&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; When
autumn was drawing in during thine early old age, in 1584, didst
thou not write that thou hadst never received a sou at the hands
of all the publishers who vended thy books?&nbsp; And as thou
wert about putting forth thy folio edition of 1584, thou didst
pray Buon, the bookseller, to give thee sixty crowns to buy wood
withal, and make thee a bright fire in winter weather, and
comfort thine old age with thy friend Gallandius.&nbsp; And if
Buon will not pay, then to try the other booksellers, &ldquo;that
wish to take everything and give nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was it knowledge of this passage, Master, or ignorance of
everything else, that made certain of the common steadfast dunces
of our days speak of thee as if thou hadst been a starveling,
neglected poetaster, jealous forsooth of Ma&icirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;oys Rabelais?&nbsp; See how ignorantly M. Fleury
writes, who teaches French literature withal to them of Muscovy,
and hath indited a Life of Rabelais.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rabelais
&eacute;tait rev&ecirc;tu d&rsquo;un emploi honorable; Ronsard
&eacute;tait trait&eacute; en subalterne,&rdquo; quoth this
wondrous professor.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Pierre de Ronsard, a
gentleman of a noble house, holding the revenue of many abbeys,
the friend of Mary Stuart, of the Duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, of
Charles IX., <i>he</i> is <i>trait&eacute; en subalterne</i>, and
is jealous of a frocked or unfrocked <i>manant</i> like
Ma&icirc;tre Fran&ccedil;oys!&nbsp; And then this amazing Fleury
falls foul of thine epitaph on Ma&icirc;tre Fran&ccedil;oys and
cries, &ldquo;Ronsard a voulu faire des vers m&eacute;chants; il
n&rsquo;a fait que de m&eacute;chants vers.&rdquo;&nbsp; More
truly saith M. Sainte-Beuve, &ldquo;If the good Rabelais had
returned to Meudon on the day when this epitaph was made over the
wine, he would, methinks, have laughed heartily.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
what shall be said of a Professor like the egregious M. Fleury,
who holds that Ronsard was despised at Court?&nbsp; Was there a
party at tennis when the king would not fain have had thee on his
side, declaring that he ever won when Ronsard was his
partner?&nbsp; Did he not give thee benefices, and many priories,
and call thee his father in Apollo, and even, so they say, bid
thee sit down beside him on his throne?&nbsp; Away, ye scandalous
folk, who tell us that there was strife between the Prince of
Poets and the King of Mirth.&nbsp; Naught have ye by way of proof
of your slander but the talk of Jean Bernier, a scurrilous,
starveling apothecary, who put forth his fables in 1697, a
century and a half after Ma&icirc;tre Fran&ccedil;oys died.&nbsp;
Bayle quoted this fellow in a note, and ye all steal the tattle
one from another in your dull manner, and know not whence it
comes, nor even that Bayle would none of it and mocked its
author.&nbsp; With so little knowledge is history written, and
thus doth each chattering brook of a &ldquo;Life&rdquo; swell
with its tribute &ldquo;that great Mississippi of
falsehood,&rdquo; Biography.</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>IV.<br
/>
<i>To Herodotus</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Herodotus of Halicarnassus,
greeting.&mdash;Concerning the matters set forth in your
histories, and the tales you tell about both Greeks and
Barbarians, whether they be true, or whether they be false, men
dispute not little but a great deal.&nbsp; Wherefore I, being
concerned to know the verity, did set forth to make search in
every manner, and came in my quest even unto the ends of the
earth.&nbsp; For there is an island of the Cimmerians beyond the
Straits of Heracles, some three days&rsquo; voyage to a ship that
hath a fair following wind in her sails; and there it is said
that men know many things from of old: thither, then, I came in
my inquiry.&nbsp; Now, the island is not small, but large,
greater than the whole of Hellas; and they call it Britain.&nbsp;
In that island the east wind blows for ten parts of the year, and
the people know not how to cover themselves from the cold.&nbsp;
But for the other two months of the year the sun shines fiercely,
so that some of them die thereof, and others die of the frozen
mixed drinks; for they have ice even in the summer, and this ice
they put to their liquor.&nbsp; Through the whole of this island,
from the west even to the east, there flows a river called
Thames: a great river and a laborious, but not to be likened to
the River of Egypt.</p>
<p>The mouth of this river, where I stepped out from my ship, is
exceedingly foul and of an evil savour by reason of the city on
the banks.&nbsp; Now this city is several hundred parasangs in
circumference.&nbsp; Yet a man that needed not to breathe the air
might go round it in one hour, in chariots that run under the
earth; and these chariots are drawn by creatures that breathe
smoke and sulphur, such as Orpheus mentions in his
&ldquo;Argonautica,&rdquo; if it be by Orpheus.&nbsp; The people
of the town, when I inquired of them concerning Herodotus of
Halicarnassus, looked on me with amazement, and went straightway
about their business&mdash;namely, to seek out whatsoever new
thing is coming to pass all over the whole inhabited world, and
as for things old, they take no keep of them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by diligence I learned that he who in this land
knew most concerning Herodotus was a priest, and dwelt in the
priests&rsquo; city on the river which is called the City of the
Ford of the Ox.&nbsp; But whether Io, when she wore a cow&rsquo;s
shape, had passed by that way in her wanderings, and thence comes
the name of that city, I could not (though I asked all men I met)
learn aught with certainty.&nbsp; But to me, considering this, it
seemed that Io must have come thither.&nbsp; And now farewell to
Io.</p>
<p>To the City of the Priests there are two roads: one by land;
and one by water, following the river.&nbsp; To a well-girdled
man, the land journey is but one day&rsquo;s travel; by the river
it is longer but more pleasant.&nbsp; Now that river flows, as I
said, from the west to the east.&nbsp; And there is in it a fish
called chub, which they catch; but they do not eat it, for a
certain sacred reason.&nbsp; Also there is a fish called trout,
and this is the manner of his catching.&nbsp; They build for this
purpose great dams of wood, which they call weirs.&nbsp; Having
built the weir they sit upon it with rods in their hands, and a
line on the rod, and at the end of the line a little fish.&nbsp;
There then they &ldquo;sit and spin in the sun,&rdquo; as one of
their poets says, not for a short time but for many days, having
rods in their hands and eating and drinking.&nbsp; In this wise
they angle for the fish called trout; but whether they ever catch
him or not, not having seen it, I cannot say; for it is not
pleasant to me to speak things concerning which I know not the
truth.</p>
<p>Now, after sailing and rowing against the stream for certain
days, I came to the City of the Ford of the Ox.&nbsp; Here the
river changes his name, and is called Isis, after the name of the
goddess of the Egyptians.&nbsp; But whether the Britons brought
the name from Egypt or whether the Egyptians took it from the
Britons, not knowing I prefer not to say.&nbsp; But to me it
seems that the Britons are a colony of the Egyptians, or the
Egyptians a colony of the Britons.&nbsp; Moreover, when I was in
Egypt I saw certain soldiers in white helmets, who were certainly
British.&nbsp; But what they did there (as Egypt neither belongs
to Britain nor Britain to Egypt) I know not, neither could they
tell me.&nbsp; But one of them replied to me in that line of
Homer (if the Odyssey be Homer&rsquo;s), &ldquo;We have come to a
sorry Cyprus, and a sad Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others told me that
they once marched against the Ethiopians, and having defeated
them several times, then came back again, leaving their property
to the Ethiopians.&nbsp; But as to the truth of this I leave it
to every man to form his own opinion.</p>
<p>Having come into the City of the Priests, I went forth into
the street, and found a priest of the baser sort, who for a piece
of silver led me hither and thither among the temples,
discoursing of many things.</p>
<p>Now it seemed to me a strange thing that the city was empty,
and no man dwelling therein, save a few priests only, and their
wives, and their children, who are drawn to and fro in little
carriages dragged by women.&nbsp; But the priest told me that
during half the year the city was desolate, for that there came
somewhat called &ldquo;The Long,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Vac,&rdquo;
and drave out the young priests.&nbsp; And he said that these did
no other thing but row boats, and throw balls from one to the
other, and this they were made to do, he said, that the young
priests might learn to be humble, for they are the proudest of
men.&nbsp; But whether he spoke truth or not I know not, only I
set down what he told me.&nbsp; But to anyone considering it,
this appears rather to jump with his story&mdash;namely, that the
young priests have houses on the river, painted of divers
colours, all of them empty.</p>
<p>Then the priest, at my desire, brought me to one of the
temples, that I might seek out all things concerning Herodotus
the Halicarnassian, from one who knew.&nbsp; Now this temple is
not the fairest in the city, but less fair and goodly than the
old temples, yet goodlier and more fair than the new temples; and
over the roof there is the image of an eagle made of
stone&mdash;no small marvel, but a great one, how men came to
fashion him; and that temple is called the House of Queens.&nbsp;
Here they sacrifice a boar once every year; and concerning this
they tell a certain sacred story which I know but will not
utter.</p>
<p>Then I was brought to the priest who had a name for knowing
most about Egypt, and the Egyptians, and the Assyrians, and the
Cappadocians, and all the kingdoms of the Great King.&nbsp; He
came out to me, being attired in a black robe, and wearing on his
head a square cap.&nbsp; But why the priests have square caps I
know, and he who has been initiated into the mysteries which they
call &ldquo;Matric&rdquo; knows, but I prefer not to tell.&nbsp;
Concerning the square cap, then, let this be sufficient.&nbsp;
Now, the priest received me courteously, and when I asked him,
concerning Herodotus, whether he were a true man or not, he
smiled and answered &ldquo;Abu Goosh,&rdquo; which, in the tongue
of the Arabians, means &ldquo;The Father of Liars.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he went on to speak concerning Herodotus, and he said in his
discourse that Herodotus not only told the thing which was not,
but that he did so wilfully, as one knowing the truth but
concealing it.&nbsp; For example, quoth he, &ldquo;Solon never
went to see Croesus, as Herodotus avers; nor did those about
Xerxes ever dream dreams; but Herodotus, out of his abundant
wickedness, invented these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now behold,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;how the curse of
the Gods falls upon Herodotus.&nbsp; For he pretends that he saw
Cadmeian inscriptions at Thebes.&nbsp; Now I do not believe there
were any Cadmeian inscriptions there: therefore Herodotus is most
manifestly lying.&nbsp; Moreover, this Herodotus never speaks of
Sophocles the Athenian, and why not?&nbsp; Because he, being a
child at school, did not learn Sophocles by heart: for the
tragedies of Sophocles could not have been learned at school
before they were written, nor can any man quote a poet whom he
never learned at school.&nbsp; Moreover, as all those about
Herodotus knew Sophocles well, he could not appear to them to be
learned by showing that he knew what they knew also.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then I thought the priest was making game and sport, saying first
that Herodotus could know no poet whom he had not learned at
school, and then saying that all the men of his time well knew
this poet, &ldquo;about whom everyone was talking.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the priest seemed not to know that Herodotus and Sophocles
were friends, which is proved by this, that Sophocles wrote an
ode in praise of Herodotus.</p>
<p>Then he went on, and though I were to write with a hundred
hands (like Briareus, of whom Homer makes mention) I could not
tell you all the things that the priest said against Herodotus,
speaking truly, or not truly, or sometimes correctly and
sometimes not, as often befalls mortal men.&nbsp; For Herodotus,
he said, was chiefly concerned to steal the lore of those who
came before him, such as Hecat&aelig;us, and then to escape
notice as having stolen it.&nbsp; Also he said that, being
himself cunning and deceitful, Herodotus was easily beguiled by
the cunning of others, and believed in things manifestly false,
such as the story of the Phoenix-bird.</p>
<p>Then I spoke, and said that Herodotus himself declared that he
could not believe that story; but the priest regarded me
not.&nbsp; And he said that Herodotus had never caught a
crocodile with cold pig, nor did he ever visit Assyria, nor
Babylon, nor Elephantine; but, saying that he had been in these
lands, said that which was not true.&nbsp; He also declared that
Herodotus, when he travelled, knew none of the Fat Ones of the
Egyptians, but only those of the baser sort.&nbsp; And he called
Herodotus a thief and a beguiler, and &ldquo;the same with intent
to deceive,&rdquo; as one of their own poets writes.&nbsp; And,
to be short, Herodotus, I could not tell you in one day all the
charges which are now brought against you; but concerning the
truth of these things, <i>you</i> know, not least, but most, as
to yourself being guilty or innocent.&nbsp; Wherefore, if you
have anything to show or set forth whereby you may be relieved
from the burden of these accusations, now is the time.&nbsp; Be
no longer silent; but, whether through the Oracle of the Dead, or
the Oracle of Branchid&aelig;, or that in Delphi, or Dodona, or
of Amphiaraus at Oropus, speak to your friends and lovers
(whereof I am one from of old) and let men know the very
truth.</p>
<p>Now, concerning the priests in the City of the Ford of the Ox,
it is to be said that of all men whom we know they receive
strangers most gladly, feasting them all day.&nbsp; Moreover,
they have many drinks, cunningly mixed, and of these the best is
that they call Archdeacon, naming it from one of the
priests&rsquo; offices.&nbsp; Truly, as Homer says (if the
Odyssey be Homer&rsquo;s), &ldquo;when that draught is poured
into the bowl then it is no pleasure to refrain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drinking of this wine, or nectar, Herodotus, I pledge you, and
pour forth some deal on the ground, to Herodotus of
Halicarnassus, in the House of Hades.</p>
<p>And I wish you farewell, and good be with you.&nbsp; Whether
the priest spoke truly, or not truly, even so may such good
things betide you as befall dead men.</p>

Have Wits Immortal more to fear or hope?<br />
Wits toil and travail round the Plant of Fame,<br />
Their Works its Garden, and its Growth their Aim,<br />
Then Commentators, in unwieldy Dance,<br />
Break down the Barriers of the trim Pleasance,<br />
Pursue the Poet, like Act&aelig;on&rsquo;s Hounds,<br />
Beyond the fences of his Garden Grounds,<br />
Rend from the singing Robes each borrowed Gem,<br />
Rend from the laurel&rsquo;d Brows the Diadem,<br />
And, if one Rag of Character they spare,<br />
Comes the Biographer, and strips it bare!</p>
<p>Such, Pope, has been thy Fortune, such thy Doom.<br />
Swift the Ghouls gathered at the Poet&rsquo;s Tomb,<br />
With Dust of Notes to clog each lordly Line,<br />
Warburton, Warton, Croker, Bowles, combine!<br />
Collecting Cackle, Johnson condescends<br />
To <i>interview</i> the Drudges of your Friends.<br />
Thus though your Courthope holds your merits high,<br />
And still proclaims your Poems <i>Poetry</i>,<br />
Biographers, un-Boswell-like, have sneered,<br />
And Dunces edit him whom Dunces feared!</p>
<p>They say, &ldquo;what say they?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not in vain You
ask;<br />
To tell you what they say, behold my Task!<br />
&ldquo;Methinks already I your Tears survey&rdquo;<br />
As I repeat &ldquo;the horrid Things they say.&rdquo; <a

Not frenzied Dennis smote so fell as he;<br />

Like Churchill&rsquo;s Cudgel&rsquo;s <a

<p>&ldquo;Too dull to know what his own System meant,<br />
Pope yet was skilled new Treasons to invent;<br />
A Snake that puffed himself and stung his Friends,<br />
Few Lied so frequent, for such little Ends;<br />
His mind, like Flesh inflamed, <a name="citation49"></a><a

And still, the more he writhed, he stung the more!<br />
Oft in a Quarrel, never in the Right,<br />
His Spirit sank when he was called to fight.<br />
Pope, in the Darkness mining like a Mole,<br />
Forged on Himself, as from Himself he stole,<br />
And what for Caryll once he feigned to feel,<br />
Transferred, in Letters never sent, to Steele!<br />
Still he denied the Letters he had writ,<br />
And still mistook Indecency for Wit.<br />
His very Grammar, so De Quincey cries,<br />
&lsquo;Detains the Reader, and at times defies!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fierce El-n thus: no Line escapes his Rage,<br />
And furious Foot-notes growl &rsquo;neath every Page:<br />
See St-ph-n next take up the woful Tale,<br />
Prolong the Preaching, and protract the Wail!<br />
&ldquo;Some forage Falsehoods from the North and South,<br />
But Pope, poor D-l, lied from Hand to Mouth; <a

Affected, hypocritical, and vain,<br />
A Book in Breeches, and a Fop in Grain;<br />

Pope yet possessed&rdquo;&mdash;(the Praise will make you
start)&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Mean, morbid, vain, he yet possessed a Heart!<br />
And still we marvel at the Man, and still<br />
Admire his Finish, and applaud his Skill:<br />
Though, as that fabled Barque, a phantom Form,<br />
Eternal strains, nor rounds the Cape of Storm,<br />
Even so Pope strove, nor ever crossed the Line<br />
That from the Noble separates the Fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Learned thus, and who can quite reply,<br />
Reverse the Judgment, and Retort the Lie?<br />
You reap, in arm&egrave;d Hates that haunt your Name,<br />
Reap what you sowed, the Dragon&rsquo;s Teeth of Fame:<br />
You could not write, and from unenvious Time<br />
Expect the Wreath that crowns the lofty Rhyme,<br />
You still must fight, retreat, attack, defend,<br />
And oft, to snatch a Laurel, lose a Friend!</p>
<p>The Pity of it!&nbsp; And the changing Taste<br />
Of changing Time leaves half your Work a Waste!<br />
My Childhood fled your Couplet&rsquo;s clarion tone,<br />
And sought for Homer in the Prose of Bohn.<br />
Still through the Dust of that dim Prose appears<br />
The Flight of Arrows and the Sheen of Spears;<br />
Still we may trace what Hearts heroic feel,<br />
And hear the Bronze that hurtles on the Steel!<br />
But, ah, your Iliad seems a half-pretence,<br />
Where Wits, not Heroes, prove their Skill in Fence,<br />
And great Achilles&rsquo; Eloquence doth show<br />
As if no Centaur trained him, but Boileau!</p>
<p>Again, your Verse is orderly,&mdash;and more,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;The Waves behind impel the Waves before;&rdquo;<br />
Monotonously musical they glide,<br />
Till Couplet unto Couplet hath replied.<br />
But turn to Homer!&nbsp; How his Verses sweep!<br />
Surge answers Surge and Deep doth call on Deep;<br />
This Line in Foam and Thunder issues forth,<br />
Spurred by the West or smitten by the North,<br />
Sombre in all its sullen Deeps, and all<br />
Clear at the Crest, and foaming to the Fall,<br />
The next with silver Murmur dies away,<br />
Like Tides that falter to Calypso&rsquo;s Bay!</p>
<p>Thus Time, with sordid Alchemy and dread,<br />
Turns half the Glory of your Gold to Lead;<br />
Thus Time,&mdash;at Ronsard&rsquo;s wreath that vainly
bit,&mdash;<br />
Has marred the Poet to preserve the Wit,<br />
Who almost left on Addison a stain,<br />
Whose Knife cut cleanest with a poisoned pain,&mdash;<br />
Yet Thou (strange Fate that clings to all of Thine!)<br />
When most a Wit dost most a Poet shine.<br />
In Poetry thy Dunciad expires,<br />
When Wit has shot &ldquo;her momentary Fires.&rdquo;<br />
&rsquo;Tis Tragedy that watches by the Bed<br />
&ldquo;Where tawdry Yellow strove with dirty Red,&rdquo;<br />
And Men, remembering all, can scarce deny<br />
To lay the Laurel where thine Ashes lie!</p>

<i>To Lucian of Samosata</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> what bower, oh Lucian, of your
rediscovered Islands Fortunate are you now reclining; the delight
of the fair, the learned, the witty, and the brave?&nbsp; In that
clear and tranquil climate, whose air breathes of &ldquo;violet
and lily, myrtle, and the flower of the vine,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Where the daisies are rose-scented</i>,<br />
<i>And the Rose herself has got</i><br />
<i>Perfume which on earth is not</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>among the music of all birds, and the wind-blown notes of
flutes hanging on the trees, methinks that your laughter sounds
most silvery sweet, and that Helen and fair Charmides are still
of your company.&nbsp; Master of mirth, and Soul the best
contented of all that have seen the world&rsquo;s ways clearly,
most clear-sighted of all that have made tranquillity their
bride, what other laughers dwell with you, where the crystal and
fragrant waters wander round the shining palaces and the temples
of amethyst?</p>
<p>Heine surely is with you; if, indeed, it was not one Syrian
soul that dwelt among alien men, Germans and Romans, in the
bodily tabernacles of Heine and of Lucian.&nbsp; But he was
fallen on evil times and evil tongues; while Lucian, as witty as
he, as bitter in mockery, as happily dowered with the magic of
words, lived long and happily and honoured, imprisoned in no
&ldquo;mattress-grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without Rabelais, without
Voltaire, without Heine, you would find, methinks, even the joys
of your Happy Islands lacking in zest; and, unless Plato came by
your way, none of the ancients could meet you in the lists of
sportive dialogue.</p>
<p>There, among the vines that bear twelve times in the year,
more excellent than all the vineyards of Touraine, while the
song-birds bring you flowers from vales enchanted, and the shapes
of the Blessed come and go, beautiful in wind-woven raiment of
sunset hues; there, in a land that knows not age, nor winter,
midnight, nor autumn, nor noon, where the silver twilight of
summer-dawn is perennial, where youth does not wax spectre-pale
and die; there, my Lucian, you are crowned the Prince of the
Paradise of Mirth.</p>
<p>Who would bring you, if he had the power, from the banquet
where Homer sings: Homer, who, in mockery of commentators, past
and to come, German and Greek, informed you that he was by birth
a Babylonian?&nbsp; Yet, if you, who first wrote Dialogues of the
Dead, could hear the prayer of an epistle wafted to &ldquo;lands
indiscoverable in the unheard-of West,&rdquo; you might visit
once more a world so worthy of such a mocker, so like the world
you knew so well of old.</p>
<p>Ah, Lucian, we have need of you, of your sense and of your
mockery!&nbsp; Here, where faith is sick and superstition is
waking afresh; where gods come rarely, and spectres appear at
five shillings an interview; where science is popular, and
philosophy cries aloud in the market-place, and clamour does duty
for government, and Thais and Lais are names of power&mdash;here,
Lucian, is room and scope for you.&nbsp; Can I not imagine a new
&ldquo;Auction of Philosophers,&rdquo; and what wealth might be
made by him who bought these popular sages and lecturers at his
estimate, and vended them at their own?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Whom shall we put first up
to auction?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Zeus</span>: That German in spectacles; he
seems a highly respectable man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Ho, Pessimist, come down
and let the public view you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Zeus</span>: Go on, put him up and have
done with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Who bids for the Life
Miserable, for extreme, complete, perfect, unredeemable
perdition?&nbsp; What offers for the universal extinction of the
species, and the collapse of the Conscious?</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: He does not look at
all a bad lot.&nbsp; May one put him through his paces?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Certainly; try your
luck.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: What is your name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pessimist</span>: Hartmann.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: What can you teach
me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pessimist</span>: That Life is not worth
Living.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: Wonderful!&nbsp; Most
edifying!&nbsp; How much for this lot?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Two hundred pounds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: I will write you a
cheque for the money.&nbsp; Come home, Pessimist, and begin your
lessons without more ado.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Attention!&nbsp; Here is a
magnificent article&mdash;the Positive Life, the Scientific Life,
the Enthusiastic Life.&nbsp; Who bids for a possible place in the
Calendar of the Future?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: What does he call
himself? he has a very French air.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span>: Put your own questions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: What&rsquo;s your
pedigree, my Philosopher, and previous performances?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Positivist</span>: I am by Rousseau out of
Catholicism, with a strain of the Evolution blood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: What do you believe
in?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Positivist</span>: In Man, with a large
M.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: Not in individual
Man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Positivist</span>: By no means; not even
always in Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; All men, all Churches, all
parties, all philosophies, and even the other sect of our own
Church, are perpetually in the wrong.&nbsp; Buy me, and listen to
me, and you will always be in the right.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: And, after this life,
what have you to offer me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Positivist</span>: A distinguished
position in the Choir Invisible; but not, of course, conscious
immortality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purchaser</span>: Take him away, and put
up another lot.</p>
<p>Then the Hegelian, with his Notion, and the Darwinian, with
his notions, and the Lotzian, with his Broad Church mixture of
Religion and Evolution, and the Spencerian, with that Absolute
which is a sort of a something, might all be offered with their
divers wares; and cheaply enough, Lucian, you would value them in
this auction of Sects.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is but one way to
Corinth,&rdquo; as of old; but which that way may be, oh master
of Hermotimus, we know no more than he did of old; and still we
find, of all philosophies, that the Stoic route is most to be
recommended.&nbsp; But we have our Cyrenaics too, though they are
no longer &ldquo;clothed in purple, and crowned with flowers, and
fond of drink and of female flute-players.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, here
too, you might laugh, and fail to see where the Pleasure lies,
when the Cyrenaics are no &ldquo;judges of cakes&rdquo; (nor of
ale, for that matter), and are strangers in the Courts of
Princes.&nbsp; &ldquo;To despise all things, to make use of all
things, in all things to follow pleasure only:&rdquo; that is not
the manner of the new, if it were the secret of the older
Hedonism.</p>
<p>Then, turning from the philosophers to the seekers after a
sign, what change, Lucian, would you find in them and their
ways?&nbsp; None; they are quite unaltered.&nbsp; Still our
Peregrinus, and our Peregrina too, come to us from the East, or,
if from the West, they take India on their way&mdash;India, that
secular home of drivelling creeds, and of religion in its
sacerdotage.&nbsp; Still they prattle of Brahmins and Buddhism;
though, unlike Peregrinus, they do not publicly burn themselves
on pyres, at Epsom Downs, after the Derby.&nbsp; We are not so
fortunate in the demise of our Theosophists; and our police, less
wise than the Hellenodic&aelig;, would probably not permit the
Immolation of the Quack.&nbsp; Like your Alexander, they deal in
marvels and miracles, oracles and warnings.&nbsp; All such bogy
stories as those of your &ldquo;Philopseudes,&rdquo; and the
ghost of the lady who took to table-rapping because one of her
best slippers had not been burned with her body, are gravely
investigated by the Psychical Society.</p>
<p>Even your ignorant Bibliophile is still with us&mdash;the man
without a tinge of letters, who buys up old manuscripts
&ldquo;because they are stained and gnawed, and who goes, for
proof of valued antiquity, to the testimony of the
book-worms.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the rich Bibliophile now, as in your
satire, clothes his volumes in purple morocco and gay
<i>dorures</i>, while their contents are sealed to him.</p>
<p>As to the topics of satire and gay curiosity which occupy the
lady known as &ldquo;Gyp,&rdquo; and M. Hal&eacute;vy in his
&ldquo;Les Petites Cardinal,&rdquo; if you had not exhausted the
matter in your &ldquo;Dialogues of Hetairai,&rdquo; you would be
amused to find the same old traits surviving without a touch of
change.&nbsp; One reads, in Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s French, of
Madame Cardinal, and, in your Greek, of the mother of Philinna,
and marvels that eighteen hundred years have not in one single
trifle altered the mould.&nbsp; Still the old shabby light-loves,
the old greed, the old luxury and squalor.&nbsp; Still the
unconquerable superstition that now seeks to tell fortunes by the
cards, and, in your time, resorted to the sorceress with her
magical &ldquo;bull-roarer&rdquo; or <i>turndun</i>. <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a></p>
<p>Yes, Lucian, we are the same vain creatures of doubt and
dread, of unbelief and credulity, of avarice and pretence, that
you knew, and at whom you smiled.&nbsp; Nay, our very
&ldquo;social question&rdquo; is not altered.&nbsp; Do you not
write, in &ldquo;The Runaways,&rdquo; &ldquo;The artisans will
abandon their workshops, and leave their trades, when they see
that, with all the labour that bows their bodies from dawn to
dark, they make a petty and starveling pittance, while men that
toil not nor spin are floating in Pactolus&rdquo;?</p>
<p>They begin to see this again as of yore; but whether the end
of their vision will be a laughing matter, you, fortunate Lucian,
do not need to care.&nbsp; Hail to you, and farewell!</p>

66</span>VII.<br />
<i>To Ma&icirc;tre Fran&ccedil;oys Rabelais</i>.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE COMING OF THE
COQCIGRUES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Master</span>,&mdash;In the Boreal and
Septentrional lands, turned aside from the noonday and the sun,
there dwelt of old (as thou knowest, and as Olaus voucheth) a
race of men, brave, strong, nimble, and adventurous, who had no
other care but to fight and drink.&nbsp; There, by reason of the
cold (as Virgil witnesseth), men break wine with axes.&nbsp; To
their minds, when once they were dead and gotten to Valhalla, or
the place of their Gods, there would be no other pleasure but to
swig, tipple, drink, and boose till the coming of that last
darkness and Twilight, wherein they, with their deities, should
do battle against the enemies of all mankind; which day they
rather desired than dreaded.</p>
<p>So chanced it also with Pantagruel and Brother John and their
company, after they had once partaken of the secret of the
<i>Dive Bouteille</i>.&nbsp; Thereafter they searched no longer;
but, abiding at their ease, were merry, frolic, jolly, gay, glad,
and wise; only that they always and ever did expect the awful
Coming of the Coqcigrues.&nbsp; Now concerning the day of that
coming, and the nature of them that should come, they knew
nothing; and for his part Panurge was all the more adread, as
Aristotle testifieth that men (and Panurge above others) most
fear that which they know least.&nbsp; Now it chanced one day, as
they sat at meat, with viands rare, dainty, and precious as ever
Apicius dreamed of, that there fluttered on the air a faint sound
as of sermons, speeches, orations, addresses, discourses,
lectures, and the like; whereat Panurge, pricking up his ears,
cried, &ldquo;Methinks this wind bloweth from Midlothian,&rdquo;
and so fell a trembling.</p>
<p>Next, to their aural orifices, and the avenues audient of the
brain, was borne a very melancholy sound as of harmoniums, hymns,
organ-pianos, psalteries, and the like, all playing different
airs, in a kind most hateful to the Muses.&nbsp; Then said
Panurge, as well as he might for the chattering of his teeth:
&ldquo;May I never drink if here come not the Coqcigrues!&rdquo;
and this saying and prophecy of his was true and inspired.&nbsp;
But thereon the others began to mock, flout, and gird at Panurge
for his cowardice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here am I!&rdquo; cried Brother
John, &ldquo;well-armed and ready to stand a siege; being
entrenched, fortified, hemmed-in and surrounded with great
pasties, huge pieces of salted beef, salads, fricassees, hams,
tongues, pies, and a wilderness of pleasant little tarts,
jellies, pastries, trifles, and fruits of all kinds, and I shall
not thirst while I have good wells, founts, springs, and sources
of Bordeaux wine, Burgundy, wine of the Champagne country, sack
and Canary.&nbsp; A fig for thy Coqcigrues!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as he spoke there ran up suddenly a whole legion, or
rather army, of physicians, each armed with laryngoscopes,
stethoscopes, horoscopes, microscopes, weighing machines, and
such other tools, engines, and arms as they had who, after thy
time, persecuted Monsieur de Pourceaugnac!&nbsp; And they all,
rushing on Brother John, cried out to him, &ldquo;Abstain!&nbsp;
Abstain!&rdquo;&nbsp; And one said, &ldquo;I have well diagnosed
thee, and thou art in a fair way to have the gout.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never did better in my days,&rdquo; said Brother
John.&nbsp; &ldquo;Away with thy meats and drinks!&rdquo; they
cried.&nbsp; And one said, &ldquo;He must to Royat;&rdquo; and
another, &ldquo;Hence with him to Aix;&rdquo; and a third,
&ldquo;Banish him to Wiesbaden;&rdquo; and a fourth, &ldquo;Hale
him to Gastein;&rdquo; and yet another, &ldquo;To Barbouille with
him in chains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while others felt his pulse and looked at his tongue, they
all wrote prescriptions for him like men mad.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
thy eating,&rdquo; cried he that seemed to be their leader,
&ldquo;No soup!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No soup!&rdquo; quoth Brother
John; and those cheeks of his, whereat you might have warmed your
two hands in the winter solstice, grew white as lilies.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay! and no salmon, nor any beef nor mutton!&nbsp; A
little chicken by times, <i>pericolo tuo</i>!&nbsp; Nor any game,
such as grouse, partridge, pheasant, capercailzie, wild duck; nor
any cheese, nor fruit, nor pastry, nor coffee, nor <i>eau de
vie</i>; and avoid all sweets.&nbsp; No veal, pork, nor made
dishes of any kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what may I
eat?&rdquo; quoth the good Brother, whose valour had oozed out of
the soles of his sandals.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little cold bacon at
breakfast&mdash;no eggs,&rdquo; quoth the leader of the strange
folk, &ldquo;and a slice of toast without butter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And for thy drink&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;What?&rdquo; gasped
Brother John)&mdash;&ldquo;one dessert-spoonful of whisky, with a
pint of the water of Apollinaris at luncheon and dinner.&nbsp; No
more!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this Brother John fainted, falling like a
great buttress of a hill, such as Taygetus or Erymanthus.</p>
<p>While they were busy with him, others of the frantic folk had
built great platforms of wood, whereon they all stood and spoke
at once, both men and women.&nbsp; And of these some wore red
crosses on their garments, which meaneth &ldquo;Salvation;&rdquo;
and others wore white crosses, with a little black button of
crape, to signify &ldquo;Purity;&rdquo; and others bits of blue
to mean &ldquo;Abstinence.&rdquo;&nbsp; While some of these
pursued Panurge others did beset Pantagruel; asking him very long
questions, whereunto he gave but short answers.&nbsp; Thus they
asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>Have ye Local Option here?&mdash;Pan.: What?</p>
<p>May one man drink if his neighbour be not athirst?&mdash;Pan.:
Yea!</p>
<p>Have ye Free Education?&mdash;Pan.: What?</p>
<p>Must they that have, pay to school them that have
not?&mdash;Pan.: Nay!</p>
<p>Have ye free land?&mdash;Pan.: What?</p>
<p>Have ye taken the land from the farmer, and given it to the
tailor out of work and the candlemaker masterless?&mdash;Pan.:
Nay!</p>
<p>Have your women folk votes?&mdash;Pan.: Bosh!</p>
<p>Have ye got religion?&mdash;Pan.: How?</p>
<p>Do you go about the streets at night, brawling, blowing a
trumpet before you, and making long prayers?&mdash;Pan.: Nay!</p>
<p>Have you manhood suffrage?&mdash;Pan.: Eh?</p>
<p>Is Jack as good as his master?&mdash;Pan.: Nay!</p>
<p>Have you joined the Arbitration Society?&mdash;Pan.:
<i>Quoy</i>?</p>
<p>Will you let another kick you, and will you ask his neighbour
if you deserve the same?&mdash;Pan.: Nay!</p>
<p>Do you eat what you list?&mdash;Pan.: Ay!</p>
<p>Do you drink when you are athirst?&mdash;Pan.: Ay!</p>
<p>Are you governed by the free expression of the popular
will?&mdash;Pan.: How?</p>
<p>Are you servants of priests, pulpits, and penny
papers?&mdash;Pan.: NO!</p>
<p>Now, when they heard these answers of Pantagruel they all
fell, some a weeping, some a praying, some a swearing, some an
arbitrating, some a lecturing, some a caucussing, some a
preaching, some a faith-healing, some a miracle-working, some a
hypnotising, some a writing to the daily press; and while they
were thus busy, like folk distraught, &ldquo;reforming the
island,&rdquo; Pantagruel burst out a laughing; whereat they were
greatly dismayed; for laughter killeth the whole race of
Coqcigrues, and they may not endure it.</p>
<p>Then Pantagruel and his company stole aboard a barque that
Panurge had ready in the harbour.&nbsp; And having provisioned
her well with store of meat and good drink, they set sail for the
kingdom of Entelechy, where, having landed, they were kindly
entreated; and there abide to this day; drinking of the sweet and
eating of the fat, under the protection of that intellectual
sphere which hath in all places its centre and nowhere its
circumference.</p>
<p>Such was their destiny; there was their end appointed, and
thither the Coqcigrues can never come.&nbsp; For all the air of
that land is full of laughter, which killeth Coqcigrues; and
there aboundeth the herb Pantagruelion.&nbsp; But for thee,
Master Fran&ccedil;oys, thou art not well liked in this island of
ours, where the Coqcigrues are abundant, very fierce, cruel, and
tyrannical.&nbsp; Yet thou hast thy friends, that meet and drink
to thee, and wish thee well wheresoever thou hast found thy

shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; For these reasons I attempt to convey to you
some inkling of the present state of that agreeable art which
you, madam, raised to its highest pitch of perfection.</p>
<p>As to your own works (immortal, as I believe), I have but
little that is wholly cheering to tell one who, among women of
letters, was almost alone in her freedom from a lettered
vanity.&nbsp; You are not a very popular author: your volumes are
not found in gaudy covers on every bookstall; or, if found, are
not perused with avidity by the Emmas and Catherines of our
generation.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not long since a blow was dealt (in
the estimation of the unreasoning) at your character as an author
by the publication of your familiar letters.&nbsp; The editor of
these epistles, unfortunately, did not always take your
witticisms, and he added others which were too unmistakably his
own.&nbsp; While the injudicious were disappointed by the absence
of your exquisite style and humour, the wiser sort were the more
convinced of your wisdom.&nbsp; In your letters (knowing your
correspondents) you gave but the small personal talk of the hour,
for them sufficient; for your books you reserved matter and
expression which are imperishable.&nbsp; Your admirers, if not
very numerous, include all persons of taste, who, in your favour,
are apt somewhat to abate the rule, or shake off the habit, which
commonly confines them to but temperate laudation.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis the fault of all art to seem antiquated and faded
in the eyes of the succeeding generation.&nbsp; The manners of
your age were not the manners of to-day, and young gentlemen and
ladies who think Scott &ldquo;slow,&rdquo; think Miss Austen
&ldquo;prim&rdquo; and &ldquo;dreary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, even
could you return among us, I scarcely believe that, speaking the
language of the hour, as you might, and versed in its habits, you
would win the general admiration.&nbsp; For how tame, madam, are
your characters, especially your favourite heroines! how limited
the life which you knew and described! how narrow the range of
your incidents! how correct your grammar!</p>
<p>As heroines, for example, you chose ladies like Emma, and
Elizabeth, and Catherine: women remarkable neither for the
brilliance nor for the degradation of their birth; women wrapped
up in their own and the parish&rsquo;s concerns, ignorant of
evil, as it seems, and unacquainted with vain yearnings and
interesting doubts.&nbsp; Who can engage his fancy with their
match-makings and the conduct of their affections, when so many
daring and dazzling heroines approach and solicit his regard?</p>
<p>Here are princesses dressed in white velvet stamped with
golden fleurs-de-lys&mdash;ladies with hearts of ice and lips of
fire, who count their roubles by the million, their lovers by the
score, and even their husbands, very often, in figures of some
arithmetical importance.&nbsp; With these are the immaculate
daughters of itinerant Italian musicians&mdash;maids whose souls
are unsoiled amidst the contaminations of our streets, and whose
acquaintance with the art of Phidias and Praxiteles, of
D&aelig;dalus and Scopas, is the more admirable, because entirely
derived from loving study of the inexpensive collections vended
by the plaster-of-Paris man round the corner.&nbsp; When such
heroines are wooed by the nephews of Dukes, where are your Emmas
and Elizabeths?&nbsp; Your volumes neither excite nor satisfy the
curiosities provoked by that modern and scientific fiction, which
is greatly admired, I learn, in the United States, as well as in
France and at home.</p>
<p>You erred, it cannot be denied, with your eyes open.&nbsp;
Knowing Lydia and Kitty so intimately as you did, why did you
make of them almost insignificant characters?&nbsp; With Lydia
for a heroine you might have gone far; and, had you devoted three
volumes, and the chief of your time, to the passions of Kitty,
you might have held your own, even now, in the circulating
library.&nbsp; How Lyddy, perched on a corner of the roof, first
beheld her Wickham; how, on her challenge, he climbed up by a
ladder to her side; how they kissed, caressed, swung on gates
together, met at odd seasons, in strange places, and finally
eloped: all this might have been put in the mouth of a jealous
elder sister, say Elizabeth, and you would not have been less
popular than several favourites of our time.&nbsp; Had you cast
the whole narrative into the present tense, and lingered lovingly
over the thickness of Mary&rsquo;s legs and the softness of
Kitty&rsquo;s cheeks, and the blonde fluffiness of
Wickham&rsquo;s whiskers, you would have left a romance still
dear to young ladies.</p>
<p>Or, again, you might entrance fair students still, had you
concentrated your attention on Mrs. Rushworth, who eloped with
Henry Crawford.&nbsp; These should have been the chief figures of
&ldquo;Mansfield Park.&rdquo;&nbsp; But you timidly decline to
tackle Passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let other pens,&rdquo; you write,
&ldquo;dwell on guilt and misery.&nbsp; I quit such odious
subjects as soon as I can.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, <i>there</i> is the
secret of your failure!&nbsp; Need I add that the vulgarity and
narrowness of the social circles you describe impair your
popularity?&nbsp; I scarce remember more than one lady of title,
and but very few lords (and these unessential) in all your
tales.&nbsp; Now, when we all wish to be in society, we demand
plenty of titles in our novels, at any rate, and we get lords
(and very queer lords) even from Republican authors, born in a
country which in your time was not renowned for its
literature.&nbsp; I have heard a critic remark, with a decided
air of fashion, on the brevity of the notice which your
characters give each other when they offer invitations to
dinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;An invitation to dinner next day was
despatched,&rdquo; and this demonstrates that your acquaintance
&ldquo;went out&rdquo; very little, and had but few
engagements.&nbsp; How vulgar, too, is one of your heroines, who
bids Mr. Darcy &ldquo;keep his breath to cool his
porridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; I blush for Elizabeth!&nbsp; It were
superfluous to add that your characters are debased by being
invariably mere members of the Church of England as by law
established.&nbsp; The Dissenting enthusiast, the open soul that
glides from Esoteric Buddhism to the Salvation Army, and from the
Higher Pantheism to the Higher Paganism, we look for in vain
among your studies of character.&nbsp; Nay, the very words I
employ are of unknown sound to you; so how can you help us in the
stress of the soul&rsquo;s travailings?</p>
<p>You may say that the soul&rsquo;s travailings are no affair of
yours; proving thereby that you have indeed but a lowly
conception of the duty of the novelist.&nbsp; I only remember one
reference, in all your works, to that controversy which occupies
the chief of our attention&mdash;the great controversy on
Creation or Evolution.&nbsp; Your Jane Bennet cries: &ldquo;I
have no idea of there being so much Design in the world as some
persons imagine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor do you touch on our mighty
social question, the Land Laws, save when Mrs. Bennet appears as
a Land Reformer, and rails bitterly against the cruelty &ldquo;of
settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in
favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There, madam, in that cruelly unjust performance, what a text you
had for a <i>tendenz-romanz</i>.&nbsp; Nay, you can allow Kitty
to report that a Private had been flogged, without introducing a
chapter on Flogging in the Army.&nbsp; But you formally declined
to stretch your matter out, here and there, &ldquo;with solemn
specious nonsense about something unconnected with the
story.&rdquo;&nbsp; No &ldquo;padding&rdquo; for Miss Austen! in
fact, madam, as you were born before Analysis came in, or
Passion, or Realism, or Naturalism, or Irreverence, or Religious
Open-mindedness, you really cannot hope to rival your literary
sisters in the minds of a perplexed generation.&nbsp; Your
heroines are not passionate, we do not see their red wet cheeks,
and tresses dishevelled in the manner of our frank young
M&aelig;nads.&nbsp; What says your best successor, a lady who
adds fresh lustre to a name that in fiction equals yours?&nbsp;
She says of Miss Austen: &ldquo;Her heroines have a stamp of
their own.&nbsp; <i>They have a certain gentle self-respect and
humour and hardness of heart</i> . . . Love with them does not
mean a passion as much as an interest, deep and
silent.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think one prefers them so, and that
Englishwomen should be more like Anne Elliot than Maggie
Tulliver.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the privilege I claim for my own sex
is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is
gone,&rdquo; said Anne; perhaps she insisted on a monopoly that
neither sex has all to itself.&nbsp; Ah, madam, what a relief it
is to come back to your witty volumes, and forget the follies of
to-day in those of Mr. Collins and of Mrs. Bennet!&nbsp; How
fine, nay, how noble is your art in its delicate reserve, never
insisting, never forcing the note, never pushing the sketch into
the caricature!&nbsp; You worked, without thinking of it, in the
spirit of Greece, on a labour happily limited, and exquisitely
organised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear books,&rdquo; we say, with Miss
Thackeray&mdash;&ldquo;dear books, bright, sparkling with wit and
animation, in which the homely heroines charm, the dull hours
fly, and the very bores are enchanting.&rdquo;</p>

<i>To Master Isaak Walton</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Father Isaak</span>,&mdash;When I would be
quiet and go angling it is my custom to carry in my wallet thy
pretty book, &ldquo;The Compleat Angler.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here,
methinks, if I find not trout I shall find content, and good
company, and sweet songs, fair milkmaids, and country
mirth.&nbsp; For you are to know that trout be now scarce and
whereas he was ever a fearful fish, he hath of late become so
wary that none but the cunningest anglers may be even with
him.</p>
<p>It is not as it was in your time, Father, when a man might
leave his shop in Fleet Street, of a holiday, and, when he had
stretched his legs up Tottenham Hill, come lightly to meadows
chequered with waterlilies and lady-smocks, and so fall to his
sport.&nbsp; Nay, now have the houses so much increased, like a
spreading sore (through the breaking of that excellent law of the
Conscientious King and blessed Martyr, whereby building beyond
the walls was forbidden), that the meadows are all swallowed up
in streets.&nbsp; And as to the River Lea, wherein you took many
a good trout, I read in the news sheets that &ldquo;its bed is
many inches thick in horrible filth, and the air for more than
half a mile on each side of it is polluted with a horrible,
sickening stench,&rdquo; so that we stand in dread of a new
Plague, called the Cholera.&nbsp; And so it is all about London
for many miles, and if a man, at heavy charges, betake himself to
the fields, lo you, folk are grown so greedy that none will
suffer a stranger to fish in his water.</p>
<p>So poor anglers are in sore straits.&nbsp; Unless a man be
rich and can pay great rents, he may not fish in England, and
hence spring the discontents of the times, for the angler is full
of content, if he do but take trout, but if he be driven from the
waterside, he falls, perchance, into evil company, and cries out
to divide the property of the gentle folk.&nbsp; As many now do,
even among Parliament-men, whom you loved not, Father Isaak,
neither do I love them more than Reason and Scripture bid each of
us be kindly to his neighbour.&nbsp; But, behold, the causes of
the ill content are not yet all expressed, for even where a man
hath licence to fish, he will hardly take trout in our age,
unless he be all the more cunning.&nbsp; For the fish, harried
this way and that by so many of your disciples, is exceeding shy
and artful, nor will he bite at a fly unless it falleth lightly,
just above his mouth, and floateth dry over him, for all the
world like the natural <i>ephemeris</i>.&nbsp; And we may no
longer angle with worm for him, nor with penk or minnow, nor with
the natural fly, as was your manner, but only with the
artificial, for the more difficulty the more diversion.&nbsp; For
my part I may cry, like Viator in your book, &ldquo;Master, I can
neither catch with the first nor second Angle: I have no
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we fare in England, but somewhat better north of the Tweed,
where trout are less wary, but for the most part small, except in
the extreme rough north, among horrid hills and lakes.&nbsp;
Thither, Master, as methinks you may remember, went Richard
Franck, that called himself <i>Philanthropus</i>, and was, as it
were, the Columbus of anglers, discovering for them a new
Hyperborean world.&nbsp; But Franck, doubtless, is now an angler
in the Lake of Darkness, with Nero and other tyrants, for he
followed after Cromwell, the man of blood, in the old riding
days.&nbsp; How wickedly doth Franck boast of that leader of the
giddy multitude, &ldquo;when they raged, and became restless to
find out misery for themselves and others, and the rabble would
herd themselves together,&rdquo; as you said, &ldquo;and
endeavour to govern and act in spite of authority.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So you wrote; and what said Franck, that recreant angler?&nbsp;
Doth he not praise &ldquo;Ireton, Vane, Nevill, and Martin, and
the most renowned, valorous, and victorious conqueror, Oliver
Cromwell&rdquo;?&nbsp; Natheless, with all his sins on his head,
this Franck discovered Scotland for anglers, and my heart turns
to him when he praises &ldquo;the glittering and resolute streams
of Tweed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those wilds of Assynt and Loch Rannoch, Father, we, thy
followers, may yet take trout, and forget the evils of the
times.&nbsp; But, to be done with Franck, how harshly he speaks
of thee and thy book.&nbsp; &ldquo;For you may dedicate your
opinion to what scribbling putationer you please; the <i>Compleat
Angler</i> if you will, who tells you of a tedious fly story,
extravagantly collected from antiquated authors, such as Gesner
and Dubravius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he speaks of &ldquo;Isaac
Walton, whose authority to me seems alike authentick, as is the
general opinion of the vulgar prophet,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Certain I am that Franck, if a better angler than thou, was a
worse man, who, writing his &ldquo;Dialogues Piscatorial&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Northern Memoirs&rdquo; five years after the world
welcomed thy &ldquo;Compleat Angler,&rdquo; was jealous of thy
favour with the people, and, may be, hated thee for thy loyalty
and sound faith.&nbsp; But, Master, like a peaceful man avoiding
contention, thou didst never answer this blustering Franck, but
wentest quietly about thy quiet Lea, and left him his roaring
Brora and windy Assynt.&nbsp; How could this noisy man know
thee&mdash;and know thee he did, having argued with thee in
Stafford&mdash;and not love Isaak Walton?&nbsp; A pedant angler,
I call him, a plaguy angler, so let him huff away, and turn we to
thee and to thy sweet charm in fishing for men.</p>
<p>How often, studying in thy book, have I hummed to myself that
of Horace&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Laudis amore tumes?&nbsp; Sunt certa piacula
qu&aelig; te</i><br />
<i>Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So healing a book for the frenzy of fame is thy discourse on
meadows, and pure streams, and the country life.&nbsp; How
peaceful, men say, and blessed must have been the life of this
old man, how lapped in content, and hedged about by his own
humility from the world!&nbsp; They forget, who speak thus, that
thy years, which were many, were also evil, or would have seemed
evil to divers that had tasted of thy fortunes.&nbsp; Thou wert
poor, but that, to thee, was no sorrow, for greed of money was
thy detestation.&nbsp; Thou wert of lowly rank, in an age when
gentle blood was alone held in regard; yet thy virtues made thee
hosts of friends, and chiefly among religious men, bishops, and
doctors of the Church.&nbsp; Thy private life was not
unacquainted with sorrow; thy first wife and all her fair
children were taken from thee like flowers in spring, though, in
thine age, new love and new offspring comforted thee like
&ldquo;the primrose of the later year.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thy private
griefs might have made thee bitter, or melancholy, so might the
sorrows of the State and of the Church, which were deprived of
their heads by cruel men, despoiled of their wealth, the pious
driven, like thee, from their homes; fear everywhere, everywhere
robbery and confusion: all this ruin might have angered another
temper.&nbsp; But thou, Father, didst bear all with so much
sweetness as perhaps neither natural temperament, nor a firm
faith, nor the love of angling could alone have displayed.&nbsp;
For we see many anglers (as witness Richard Franck aforesaid) who
are angry men, and myself, when I get my hooks entangled at every
cast in a tree, have come nigh to swear prophane.</p>
<p>Also we see religious men that are sour and fanatical, no rare
thing in the party that professes godliness.&nbsp; But neither
private sorrow nor public grief could abate thy natural
kindliness, nor shake a religion which was not untried, but had,
indeed, passed through the furnace like fine gold.&nbsp; For if
we find not Faith at all times easy, because of the oppositions
of Science, and the searching curiosity of men&rsquo;s minds,
neither was Faith a matter of course in thy day.&nbsp; For the
learned and pious were greatly tossed about, like worthy Mr.
Chillingworth, by doubts wavering between the Church of Rome and
the Reformed Church of England.&nbsp; The humbler folk, also,
were invited, now here, now there, by the clamours of fanatical
Nonconformists, who gave themselves out to be somebody, while
Atheism itself was not without many to witness to it.&nbsp;
Therefore, such a religion as thine was not, so to say, a mere
innocence of evil in the things of our Belief, but a reasonable
and grounded faith, strong in despite of oppositions.&nbsp; Happy
was the man in whom temper, and religion, and the love of the
sweet country and an angler&rsquo;s pastime so conveniently
combined; happy the long life which held in its hand that
threefold clue through the labyrinth of human fortunes!&nbsp;
Around thee Church and State might fall in ruins, and might be
rebuilded, and thy tears would not be bitter, nor thy triumph
cruel.</p>
<p>Thus, by God&rsquo;s blessing, it befell thee</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Nec turpem senectam</i><br />
<i>Degere, nec cithara carentem</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would, Father, that I could get at the verity about thy
poems.&nbsp; Those recommendatory verses with which thou didst
grace the Lives of Dr. Donne and others of thy friends, redound
more to the praise of thy kind heart than thy fancy.&nbsp; But
what or whose was the pastoral poem of &ldquo;Thealma and
Clearchus,&rdquo; which thou didst set about printing in 1678,
and gavest to the world in 1683?&nbsp; Thou gavest John Chalkhill
for the author&rsquo;s name, and a John Chalkhill of thy kindred
died at Winchester, being eighty years of his age, in 1679.&nbsp;
Now thou speakest of John Chalkhill as &ldquo;a friend of Edmund
Spenser&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and how could this be?</p>
<p>Are they right who hold that John Chalkhill was but a name of
a friend, borrowed by thee out of modesty, and used as a cloak to
cover poetry of thine own inditing?&nbsp; When Mr. Flatman writes
of Chalkhill, &rsquo;tis in words well fitted to thine own
merit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Happy old man, whose worth all mankind knows<br />
Except himself, who charitably shows<br />
The ready road to virtue and to praise,<br />
The road to many long and happy days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However it be, in that road, by quiet streams and through
green pastures, thou didst walk all thine almost century of
years, and we, who stray into thy path out of the highway of
life, we seem to hold thy hand, and listen to thy cheerful
voice.&nbsp; If our sport be worse, may our content be equal, and
our praise, therefore, none the less.&nbsp; Father, if Master
Stoddard, the great fisher of Tweedside, be with thee, greet him
for me, and thank him for those songs of his, and perchance he
will troll thee a catch of our dear River.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tweed! winding and wild! where the heart is
unbound,<br />
They know not, they dream not, who linger around,<br />
How the saddened will smile, and the wasted rewin<br />
From thee&mdash;the bliss withered within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps thou wilt better love,</p>
<blockquote><p>The lanesome Tala and the Lyne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Manor wi&rsquo; its mountain rills,<br />
An&rsquo; Etterick, whose waters twine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; Yarrow frae the forest hills;<br />
An&rsquo; Gala, too, and Teviot bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; mony a stream o&rsquo; playfu&rsquo;
speed,<br />
Their kindred valleys a&rsquo; unite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amang the braes o&rsquo; bonnie Tweed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Master, may you sing against each other, you two good old
anglers, like Peter and Corydon, that sang in your golden
age.</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>X.<br
/>
<i>To M. Chapelain</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;You were a popular
poet, and an honourable, over-educated, upright gentleman.&nbsp;
Of the latter character you can never be deprived, and I doubt
not it stands you in better stead where you are, than the laurels
which flourished so gaily, and faded so soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Laurel is green for a season, and Love is fair for
a day,<br />
But Love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not
May.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know not if Mr. Swinburne is correct in his botany, but
<i>your</i> laurel certainly outlived not May, nor can we hope
that you dwell where Orpheus and where Homer are.&nbsp; Some
other crown, some other Paradise, we cannot doubt it, awaited
<i>un si bon homme</i>.&nbsp; But the moral excellence that even
Boileau admitted, <i>la foi, l&rsquo;honneur, la
probit&eacute;</i>, do not in Parnassus avail the popular poet,
and some luckless Glatigny or Th&eacute;ophile, Regnier or
Gilbert, attains a kind of immortality denied to the man of many
contemporary editions, and of a great commercial success.</p>
<p>If ever, for the confusion of Horace, any Poet was Made, you,
Sir, should have been that fortunately manufactured
article.&nbsp; You were, in matters of the Muses, the child of
many prayers.&nbsp; Never, since Adam&rsquo;s day, have any
parents but yours prayed for a poet-child.&nbsp; Then Destiny,
that mocks the desires of men in general, and fathers in
particular, heard the appeal, and presented M. Chapelain and
Jeanne Corbi&egrave;re his wife with the future author of
&ldquo;La Pucelle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh futile hopes of men, <i>O
pectora c&aelig;ca</i>!&nbsp; All was done that education could
do for a genius which, among other qualities, &ldquo;especially
lacked fire and imagination,&rdquo; and an ear for
verse&mdash;sad defects these in a child of the Muses.&nbsp; Your
training in all the mechanics and metaphysics of criticism might
have made you exclaim, like Rasselas, &ldquo;Enough!&nbsp; Thou
hast convinced me that no human being can ever be a
Poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unhappily, you succeeded in convincing
Cardinal Richelieu that to be a Poet was well within your powers,
you received a pension of one thousand crowns, and were made
Captain of the Cardinal&rsquo;s Minstrels, as M. de
Tr&eacute;ville was Captain of the King&rsquo;s Musketeers.</p>
<p>Ah, pleasant age to live in, when good intentions in poetry
were more richly endowed than ever is Research, even Research in
Prehistoric English, among us niggard moderns!&nbsp; How I wish I
knew a Cardinal, or even, as you did, a Prime Minister, who would
praise and pension <i>me</i>; but envy be still!&nbsp; Your
existence was made happy indeed; you constructed odes, corrected
sonnets, presided at the H&ocirc;tel Rambouillet, while the
learned ladies were still young and fair, and you enjoyed a
prodigious celebrity on the score of your yet unpublished
Epic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who, indeed,&rdquo; says a sympathetic author,
M. Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, &ldquo;who could expect less than a
miracle from a man so deeply learned in the laws of art&mdash;a
perfect Turk in the science of poetry, a person so well
pensioned, and so favoured by the great?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bishops and
politicians combined in perfect good faith to advertise your
merits.&nbsp; Hard must have been the heart that could resist the
testimonials of your skill as a poet offered by the Duc de
Montausier, and the learned Huet, Bishop of Avranches, and
Monseigneur Godeau, Bishop of Vence, and M. Colbert, who had such
a genius for finance.</p>
<p>If bishops and politicians and Prime Ministers skilled in
finance, and some critics (M&eacute;nage and Sarrazin and
Vaugelas), if ladies of birth and taste, if all the world in
fact, combined to tell you that you were a great poet, how can we
blame you for taking yourself seriously, and appraising yourself
at the public estimate?</p>
<p>It was not in human nature to resist the evidence of the
bishops especially, and when every minor poet believes in himself
on the testimony of his own conceit, you may be acquitted of
vanity if you listened to the plaudits of your friends.&nbsp;
Nay, you ventured to pronounce judgment on
contemporaries&mdash;whom Posterity has preferred to your
perfections.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moli&egrave;re,&rdquo; said you,
&ldquo;understands the genius of comedy, and presents it in a
natural style.&nbsp; The plot of his best pieces is borrowed, but
not without judgment; his <i>morale</i> is fair, and he has only
to avoid scurrility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent, unconscious, popular Chapelain!</p>
<p>Of yourself you observed, in a Report on contemporary
literature, that your &ldquo;courage and sincerity never allowed
you to tolerate work not absolutely good.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet
you regarded &ldquo;La Pucelle&rdquo; with some complacency.</p>
<p>On the &ldquo;Pucelle&rdquo; you were occupied during a
generation of mortal men.&nbsp; I marvel not at the length of
your labours, as you received a yearly pension till the Epic was
finished, but your Muse was no Alcmena, and no Hercules was the
result of that prolonged night of creation.&nbsp; First you
gravely wrote out all the composition in prose: the task occupied
you for five whole years.&nbsp; Ah, why did you not leave it in
that commonplace but appropriate medium?&nbsp; What says the
Pr&eacute;cieuse about you in Boileau&rsquo;s satire?</p>
<blockquote><p>In Chapelain, for all his foes have said,<br />
She finds but one defect, he can&rsquo;t be read;<br />
Yet thinks the world might taste his Maiden&rsquo;s woes,<br />
If only he would turn his verse to prose!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse had been prose, and prose, perhaps, it should have
remained.&nbsp; Yet for this precious &ldquo;Pucelle,&rdquo; in
the age when &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; was sold for five
pounds, you are believed to have received about four
thousand.&nbsp; Horace was wrong, mediocre poets may exist (now
and then), and he was a wise man who first spoke of <i>aurea
mediocritas</i>.&nbsp; At length the great work was achieved, a
work thrice blessed in its theme, that divine Maiden to whom
France owes all, and whom you and Voltaire have recompensed so
strangely.&nbsp; In folio, in italics, with a score of portraits
and engravings, and <i>culs de lampe</i>, the great work was
given to the world, and had a success.&nbsp; Six editions in
eighteen months are figures which fill the poetic heart with envy
and admiration.&nbsp; And then, alas! the bubble burst.&nbsp; A
great lady, Madame de Longueville, hearing the
&ldquo;Pucelle&rdquo; read aloud, murmured that it was
&ldquo;perfect indeed, but perfectly wearisome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
the satires began, and the satirists never left you till your
poetic reputation was a rag, till the mildest Abb&eacute; at
M&eacute;nage&rsquo;s had his cheap sneer for Chapelain.</p>
<p>I make no doubt, Sir, that envy and jealousy had much to do
with the onslaught on your &ldquo;Pucelle.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
qualities, alas! are not strange to literary minds; does not even
Hesiod tell us that &ldquo;potter hates potter, and poet hates
poet&rdquo;?&nbsp; But contemporary spites do not harm true
genius.&nbsp; Who suffered more than Moli&egrave;re from
cabals?&nbsp; Yet neither the court nor the town ever deserted
him, and he is still the joy of the world.&nbsp; I admit that his
adversaries were weaker than yours.&nbsp; What were Boursault and
Le Boulanger, and Thomas Corneille and De Vis&eacute;, what were
they all compared to your enemy, Boileau?&nbsp; Brossette tells a
story which really makes a man pity you.&nbsp; You remember M. de
Puimorin, who, to be in the fashion, laughed at your once popular
Epic.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all very well,&rdquo; said you,
&ldquo;for a man to laugh who cannot even read.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whereon M. de Puimorin replied: &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;avoit
que trop s&ucirc; lire, depuis que Chapelain s&rsquo;&eacute;toit
avis&eacute; de faire imprimer.&rdquo;&nbsp; A new horror had
been added to the accomplishment of reading since Chapelain had
published.&nbsp; This repartee was applauded, and M. de Puimorin
tried to turn it into an epigram.&nbsp; He did complete the last
couplet,</p>
<blockquote><p>H&eacute;las! pour mes p&eacute;ch&eacute;s, je
n&rsquo;ai s&ucirc; que trop lire<br />
Depuis que tu fais imprimer.</p>

<p>But by no labour would M. de Puimorin achieve the first two
lines of his epigram.&nbsp; Then you remember what great allies
came to his assistance.&nbsp; I almost blush to think that M.
Despr&eacute;aux, M. Racine, and M. de Moli&egrave;re, the three
most renowned wits of the time, conspired to complete the poor
jest, and assail you.&nbsp; Well, bubble as your poetry was, you
may be proud that it needed all these sharpest of pens to prick
the bubble.&nbsp; Other poets, as popular as you, have been
annihilated by an article.&nbsp; Macaulay put forth his hand, and
&ldquo;Satan Montgomery&rdquo; was no more.&nbsp; It did not need
a Macaulay, the laughter of a mob of little critics was enough to
blow him into space; but you probably have met Montgomery, and of
contemporary failures or successes I do not speak.</p>
<p>I wonder, sometimes, whether the consensus of criticism ever
made you doubt for a moment whether, after all, you were not a
false child of Apollo?&nbsp; Was your complacency tortured, as
the complacency of true poets has occasionally been, by
doubts?&nbsp; Did you expect posterity to reverse the verdict of
the satirists, and to do you justice?&nbsp; You answered your
earliest assailant, Lini&egrave;re, and, by a few changes of
words, turned his epigrams into flattery.&nbsp; But I fancy, on
the whole, you remained calm, unmoved, wrapped up in admiration
of yourself.&nbsp; According to M. de Marivaux, who reviewed, as
I am doing, the spirits of the mighty dead, you &ldquo;conceived,
on the strength of your reputation, a great and serious
veneration for yourself and your genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably
you were protected by the invulnerable armour of an honest
vanity, probably you declared that mere jealousy dictated the
lines of Boileau, and that Chapelain&rsquo;s real fault was his
popularity, and his pecuniary success,</p>
<blockquote><p>Qu&rsquo;il soit le mieux rent&eacute; de tous les
beaux-esprits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, you would avow, was your offence, and perhaps you were
not altogether mistaken.&nbsp; Yet posterity declines to read a
line of yours, and, as we think of you, we are again set face to
face with that eternal problem, how far is popularity a test of
poetry?&nbsp; Burns was a poet: and popular.&nbsp; Byron was a
popular poet, and the world agrees in the verdict of their own
generations.&nbsp; But Montgomery, though he sold so well, was no
poet, nor, Sir, I fear, was your verse made of the stuff of
immortality.&nbsp; Criticism cannot hurt what is truly great; the
Cardinal and the Academy left Chim&egrave;ne as fair as ever, and
as adorable.&nbsp; It is only pinchbeck that perishes under the
acids of satire: gold defies them.&nbsp; Yet I sometimes ask
myself, does the existence of popularity like yours justify the
malignity of satire, which blesses neither him who gives, nor him
who takes?&nbsp; Are poisoned arrows fair against a bad
poet?&nbsp; I doubt it, Sir, holding that, even unpricked, a
poetic bubble must soon burst by its own nature.&nbsp; Yet satire
will assuredly be written so long as bad poets are successful,
and bad poets will assuredly reflect that their assailants are
merely envious, and (while their vogue lasts) that the purchasing
public is the only judge.&nbsp; After all, the bad poet who is
popular and &ldquo;sells&rdquo; is not a whit worse than the bad
poets who are unpopular, and who deride his songs.</p>

<i>To Sir John Maundeville</i>, <i>Kt.</i><br />
(<span class="GutSmall">OF THE WAYS INTO YNDE</span>.)</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>,&mdash;Wit you well that
men holden you but light, and some clepen you a Liar.&nbsp; And
they say that you never were born in Englond, in the town of
Seynt Albones, nor have seen and gone through manye diverse
Londes.&nbsp; And there goeth an old knight at arms, and one that
connes Latyn, and hath been beyond the sea, and hath seen Prester
John&rsquo;s country.&nbsp; And he hath been in an Yle that men
clepen Burmah, and there bin women bearded.&nbsp; Now men call
him Colonel Henry Yule, and he hath writ of thee in his great
booke, Sir John, and he holds thee but lightly.&nbsp; For he
saith that ye did pill your tales out of Odoric his book, and
that ye never saw snails with shells as big as houses, nor never
met no Devyls, but part of that ye say, ye took it out of William
of Boldensele his book, yet ye took not his wisdom, withal, but
put in thine own foolishness.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Sir John, for
the frailty of Mankynde, ye are held a good fellow, and a merry;
so now, come, let me tell you of the new ways into Ynde.</p>
<p>In that Lond they have a Queen that governeth all the Lond,
and all they ben obeyssant to her.&nbsp; And she is the Queen of
Englond; for Englishmen have taken all the Lond of Ynde.&nbsp;
For they were right good werryoures of old, and wyse, noble, and
worthy.&nbsp; But of late hath risen a new sort of Englishman
very puny and fearful, and these men clepen Radicals.&nbsp; And
they go ever in fear, and they scream on high for dread in the
streets and the houses, and they fain would flee away from all
that their fathers gat them with the sword.&nbsp; And this sort
men call Scuttleres, but the mean folk and certain of the baser
sort hear them gladly, and they say ever that Englishmen should
flee out of Ynde.</p>
<p>Fro Englond men gon to Ynde by many dyverse Contreyes.&nbsp;
For Englishmen ben very stirring and nymble.&nbsp; For they ben
in the seventh climate, that is of the Moon.&nbsp; And the Moon
(ye have said it yourself, Sir John, natheless, is it true) is of
lightly moving, for to go diverse ways, and see strange things,
and other diversities of the Worlde.&nbsp; Wherefore Englishmen
be lightly moving, and far wandering.&nbsp; And they gon to Ynde
by the great Sea Ocean.&nbsp; First come they to Gibraltar, that
was the point of Spain, and builded upon a rock; and there ben
apes, and it is so strong that no man may take it.&nbsp;
Natheless did Englishmen take it fro the Spanyard, and all to
hold the way to Ynde.&nbsp; For ye may sail all about Africa, and
past the Cape men clepen of Good Hope, but that way unto Ynde is
long and the sea is weary.&nbsp; Wherefore men rather go by the
Midland sea, and Englishmen have taken many Yles in that sea.</p>
<p>For first they have taken an Yle that is clept Malta; and
therein built they great castles, to hold it against them of
Fraunce, and Italy, and of Spain.&nbsp; And from this Ile of
Malta Men gon to Cipre.&nbsp; And Cipre is right a good Yle, and
a fair, and a great, and it hath 4 principal Cytees within
him.&nbsp; And at Famagost is one of the principal Havens of the
sea that is in the world, and Englishmen have but a lytel while
gone won that Yle from the Sarazynes.&nbsp; Yet say that sort of
Englishmen where of I told you, that is puny and sore adread,
that the Lond is poisonous and barren and of no avail, for that
Lond is much more hotter than it is here.&nbsp; Yet the
Englishmen that ben werryoures dwell there in tents, and the
skill is that they may ben the more fresh.</p>
<p>From Cypre, Men gon to the Lond of Egypte, and in a Day and a
Night he that hath a good wind may come to the Haven of
Alessandrie.&nbsp; Now the Lond of Egypt longeth to the Soudan,
yet the Soudan longeth not to the Lond of Egypt.&nbsp; And when I
say this, I do jape with words, and may hap ye understond me
not.&nbsp; Now Englishmen went in shippes to Alessandrie, and
brent it, and over ran the Lond, and their soudyours warred agen
the Bedoynes, and all to hold the way to Ynde.&nbsp; For it is
not long past since Frenchmen let dig a dyke, through the narrow
spit of lond, from the Midland sea to the Red sea, wherein was
Pharaoh drowned.&nbsp; So this is the shortest way to Ynde there
may be, to sail through that dyke, if men gon by sea.</p>
<p>But all the Lond of Egypt is clepen the Vale enchaunted; for
no man may do his business well that goes thither, but always
fares he evil, and therefore clepen they Egypt the Vale perilous,
and the sepulchre of reputations.&nbsp; And men say there that is
one of the entrees of Helle.&nbsp; In that Vale is plentiful lack
of Gold and Silver, for many misbelieving men, and many Christian
men also, have gone often time for to take of the Thresoure that
there was of old, and have pilled the Thresoure, wherefore there
is none left.&nbsp; And Englishmen have let carry thither great
store of our Thresoure, 9,000,000 of Pounds sterling, and whether
they will see it agen I misdoubt me.&nbsp; For that Vale is alle
fulle of Develes and Fiendes that men clepen Bondholderes, for
that Egypt from of olde is the Lond of Bondage.&nbsp; And
whatsoever Thresoure cometh into the Lond, these Devyls of
Bondholders grabben the same.&nbsp; Natheless by that Vale do
Englishmen go unto Ynde, and they gon by Aden, even to Kurrachee,
at the mouth of the Flood of Ynde.&nbsp; Thereby they send their
souldyours, when they are adread of them of Muscovy.</p>
<p>For, look you, there is another way into Ynde, and thereby the
men of Muscovy are fain to come, if the Englishmen let them
not.&nbsp; That way cometh by Desert and Wildernesse, from the
sea that is clept Caspian, even to Khiva, and so to Merv; and
then come ye to Zulfikar and Penjdeh, and anon to Herat, that is
called the Key of the Gates of Ynde.&nbsp; Then ye win the lond
of the Emir of the Afghauns, a great prince and a rich, and he
hath in his Thresoure more crosses, and stars, and coats that
captains wearen, than any other man on earth.</p>
<p>For all they of Muscovy, and all Englishmen maken him gifts,
and he keepeth the gifts, and he keepeth his own counsel.&nbsp;
For his lond lieth between Ynde and the folk of Muscovy,
wherefore both Englishmen and men of Muscovy would fain have him
friendly, yea, and independent.&nbsp; Wherefore they of both
parties give him clocks, and watches, and stars, and crosses, and
culverins, and now and again they let cut the throats of his men
some deal, and pill his country.&nbsp; Thereby they both set up
their rest that the Emir will be independent, yea, and
friendly.&nbsp; But his men love him not, neither love they the
English, nor the Muscovy folk, for they are worshippers of
Mahound, and endure not Christian men.&nbsp; And they love not
them that cut their throats, and burn their country.</p>
<p>Now they of Muscovy ben Devyls, and they ben subtle for to
make a thing seme otherwise than it is, for to deceive
mankind.&nbsp; Wherefore Englishmen putten no trust in them of
Muscovy, save only the Englishmen clept Radicals, for they make
as if they loved these Develes, out of the fear and dread of war
wherein they go, and would be slaves sooner than fight.&nbsp; But
the folk of Ynde know not what shall befall, nor whether they of
Muscovy will take the Lond, or Englishmen shall keep it, so that
their hearts may not enduren for drede.&nbsp; And methinks that
soon shall Englishmen and Muscovy folk put their bodies in
adventure, and war one with another, and all for the way to
Ynde.</p>
<p>But St. George for Englond, I say, and so enough; and may the
Seyntes hele thee, Sir John, of thy Gowtes Artetykes, that thee
tormenten.&nbsp; But to thy Boke I list not to give no
credence.</p>
<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>XII.<br />
<i>To Alexandre Dumas</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;There are moments when
the wheels of life, even of such a life as yours, run slow, and
when mistrust and doubt overshadow even the most intrepid
disposition.&nbsp; In such a moment, towards the ending of your
days, you said to your son, M. Alexandre Dumas, &ldquo;I seem to
see myself set on a pedestal which trembles as if it were founded
on the sands.&rdquo;&nbsp; These sands, your uncounted volumes,
are all of gold, and make a foundation more solid than the
rock.&nbsp; As well might the singer of Odysseus, or the authors
of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; or the first inventors of
the stories of Boccaccio, believe that their works were
perishable (their names, indeed, have perished), as the creator
of &ldquo;Les Trois Mousquetaires&rdquo; alarm himself with the
thought that the world could ever forget Alexandre Dumas.</p>
<p>Than yours there has been no greater nor more kindly and
beneficent force in modern letters.&nbsp; To Scott, indeed, you
owed the first impulse of your genius; but, once set in motion,
what miracles could it not accomplish?&nbsp; Our dear Porthos was
overcome, at last, by a super-human burden; but your imaginative
strength never found a task too great for it.&nbsp; What an
extraordinary vigour, what health, what an overflow of force was
yours!&nbsp; It is good, in a day of small and laborious
ingenuities, to breathe the free air of your books, and dwell in
the company of Dumas&rsquo;s men&mdash;so gallant, so frank, so
indomitable, such swordsmen, and such trenchermen.&nbsp; Like M.
de Rochefort in &ldquo;Vingt Ans Apr&egrave;s,&rdquo; like that
prisoner of the Bastille, your genius &ldquo;n&rsquo;est que
d&rsquo;un parti, c&rsquo;est du parti du grand air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seems to radiate from you a still persistent energy and
enjoyment; in that current of strength not only your characters
live, frolic, kindly, and sane, but even your very collaborators
were animated by the virtue which went out of you.&nbsp; How else
can we explain it, the dreary charge which feeble and envious
tongues have brought against you, in England and at home?&nbsp;
They say you employed in your novels and dramas that vicarious
aid which, in the slang of the studio, the
&ldquo;sculptor&rsquo;s ghost&rdquo; is fabled to afford.</p>
<p>Well, let it be so; these ghosts, when uninspired by you, were
faint and impotent as &ldquo;the strengthless tribes of the
dead&rdquo; in Homer&rsquo;s Hades, before Odysseus had poured
forth the blood that gave them a momentary valour.&nbsp; It was
from you and your inexhaustible vitality that these collaborating
spectres drew what life they possessed; and when they parted from
you they shuddered back into their nothingness.&nbsp; Where are
the plays, where the romances which Maquet and the rest wrote in
their own strength?&nbsp; They are forgotten with last
year&rsquo;s snows; they have passed into the wide waste-paper
basket of the world.&nbsp; You say of D&rsquo;Artagnan, when
severed from his three friends&mdash;from Porthos, Athos, and
Aramis&mdash;&ldquo;he felt that he could do nothing, save on the
condition that each of these companions yielded to him, if one
may so speak, a share of that electric fluid which was his gift
from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man of letters ever had so great a measure of that gift as
you; none gave of it more freely to all who came&mdash;to the
chance associate of the hour, as to the characters, all so burly
and full-blooded, who flocked from your brain.&nbsp; Thus it was
that you failed when you approached the supernatural.&nbsp; Your
ghosts had too much flesh and blood, more than the living persons
of feebler fancies.&nbsp; A writer so fertile, so rapid, so
masterly in the ease with which he worked, could not escape the
reproaches of barren envy.&nbsp; Because you overflowed with wit,
you could not be &ldquo;serious;&rdquo; because you created with
a word, you were said to scamp your work; because you were never
dull, never pedantic, incapable of greed, you were to be censured
as desultory, inaccurate, and prodigal.</p>
<p>A generation suffering from mental and physical
an&aelig;mia&mdash;a generation devoted to the &ldquo;chiselled
phrase,&rdquo; to accumulated &ldquo;documents,&rdquo; to
microscopic porings over human baseness, to minute and disgustful
records of what in humanity is least human&mdash;may readily
bring these unregarded and railing accusations.&nbsp; Like one of
the great and good-humoured Giants of Rabelais, you may hear the
murmurs from afar, and smile with disdain.&nbsp; To you, who can
amuse the world&mdash;to you who offer it the fresh air of the
highway, the battlefield, and the sea&mdash;the world must always
return: escaping gladly from the boudoirs and the <i>bouges</i>,
from the surgeries and hospitals, and dead rooms, of M. Daudet
and M. Zola and of the wearisome De Goncourt.</p>
<p>With all your frankness, and with that queer morality of the
Camp which, if it swallows a camel now and again, never strains
at a gnat, how healthy and wholesome, and even pure, are your
romances!&nbsp; You never gloat over sin, nor dabble with an ugly
curiosity in the corruptions of sense.&nbsp; The passions in your
tales are honourable and brave, the motives are clearly
human.&nbsp; Honour, Love, Friendship make the threefold cord,
the clue your knights and dames follow through how delightful a
labyrinth of adventures!&nbsp; Your greatest books, I take the
liberty to maintain, are the Cycle of the Valois (&ldquo;La Reine
Margot,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Dame de Montsoreau,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les
Quarante-cinq&rdquo;), and the Cycle of Louis Treize and Louis
Quatorze (&ldquo;Les Trois Mousquetaires,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vingt Ans
Apr&egrave;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Vicomte de Bragelonne&rdquo;);
and, beside these two trilogies&mdash;a lonely monument, like the
sphinx hard by the three pyramids&mdash;&ldquo;Monte
Cristo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these romances how easy it would have been for you to burn
incense to that great goddess, Lubricity, whom our critic says
your people worship.&nbsp; You had Brant&ocirc;me, you had
Tallemant, you had R&eacute;tif, and a dozen others, to furnish
materials for scenes of voluptuousness and of blood that would
have outdone even the present <i>naturalistes</i>.&nbsp; From
these alcoves of &ldquo;Les Dames Galantes,&rdquo; and from the
torture chambers (M. Zola would not have spared us one starting
sinew of brave La Mole on the rack) you turned, as Scott would
have turned, without a thought of their profitable literary
uses.&nbsp; You had other metal to work on: you gave us that
superstitious and tragical true love of La Mole&rsquo;s, that
devotion&mdash;how tender and how pure!&mdash;of Bussy for the
Dame de Montsoreau.&nbsp; You gave us the valour of
D&rsquo;Artagnan, the strength of Porthos, the melancholy
nobility of Athos: Honour, Chivalry, and Friendship.&nbsp; I
declare your characters are real people to me and old
friends.&nbsp; I cannot bear to read the end of
&ldquo;Bragelonne,&rdquo; and to part with them for ever.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Suppose Porthos, Athos, and Aramis should enter with a
noiseless swagger, curling their moustaches.&rdquo;&nbsp; How we
would welcome them, forgiving D&rsquo;Artagnan even his hateful
<i>fourberie</i> in the case of Milady.&nbsp; The brilliance of
your dialogue has never been approached: there is wit everywhere;
repartees glitter and ring like the flash and clink of
small-swords.&nbsp; Then what duels are yours! and what
inimitable battle-pieces!&nbsp; I know four good fights of one
against a multitude, in literature.&nbsp; These are the Death of
Gretir the Strong, the Death of Gunnar of Lithend, the Death of
Hereward the Wake, the Death of Bussy d&rsquo;Amboise.&nbsp; We
can compare the strokes of the heroic fighting-times with those
described in later days; and, upon my word, I do not know that
the short sword of Gretir, or the bill of Skarphedin, or the bow
of Gunnar was better wielded than the rapier of your Bussy or the
sword and shield of Kingsley&rsquo;s Hereward.</p>
<p>They say your fencing is unhistorical; no doubt it is so, and
you knew it.&nbsp; La Mole could not have lunged on Coconnas
&ldquo;after deceiving circle;&rdquo; for the parry was not
invented except by your immortal Chicot, a genius in advance of
his time.&nbsp; Even so Hamlet and Laertes would have fought with
shields and axes, not with small swords.&nbsp; But what matters
this pedantry?&nbsp; In your works we hear the Homeric Muse
again, rejoicing in the clash of steel; and even, at times, your
very phrases are unconsciously Homeric.</p>
<p>Look at these men of murder, on the Eve of St. Bartholomew,
who flee in terror from the Queen&rsquo;s chamber, and
&ldquo;find the door too narrow for their flight:&rdquo; the very
words were anticipated in a line of the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo;
concerning the massacre of the Wooers.&nbsp; And the picture of
Catherine de M&eacute;dicis, prowling &ldquo;like a wolf among
the bodies and the blood,&rdquo; in a passage of the
Louvre&mdash;the picture is taken unwittingly from the
&ldquo;Iliad.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was in you that reserve of
primitive force, that epic grandeur and simplicity of
diction.&nbsp; This is the force that animates &ldquo;Monte
Cristo,&rdquo; the earlier chapters, the prison, and the
escape.&nbsp; In later volumes of that romance, methinks, you
stoop your wing.&nbsp; Of your dramas I have little room, and
less skill, to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Antony,&rdquo; they tell me,
was &ldquo;the greatest literary event of its time,&rdquo; was a
restoration of the stage.&nbsp; &ldquo;While Victor Hugo needs
the cast-off clothes of history, the wardrobe and costume, the
sepulchre of Charlemagne, the ghost of Barbarossa, the coffins of
Lucretia Borgia, Alexandre Dumas requires no more than a room in
an inn, where people meet in riding cloaks, to move the soul with
the last degree of terror and of pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reproach of being amusing has somewhat dimmed your
fame&mdash;for a moment.&nbsp; The shadow of this tyranny will
soon be overpast; and when &ldquo;La Cur&eacute;e&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Pot-Bouille&rdquo; are more forgotten than &ldquo;Le Grand
Cyrus,&rdquo; men and women&mdash;and, above all, boys&mdash;will
laugh and weep over the page of Alexandre Dumas.&nbsp; Like Scott
himself, you take us captive in our childhood.&nbsp; I remember a
very idle little boy who was busy with the &ldquo;Three
Musketeers&rdquo; when he should have been occupied with
&ldquo;Wilkins&rsquo;s Latin Prose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Twenty
years after&rdquo; (alas! and more) he is still constant to that
gallant company; and, at this very moment, is breathlessly
wondering whether Grimaud will steal M. de Beaufort out of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s prison.</p>
<h2><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>XIII.<br />
<i>To Theocritus</i>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sweet</span>, methinks, is the
whispering sound of yonder pine-tree,&rdquo; so, Theocritus, with
that sweet word &#7937;&delta;&#8059;, didst thou begin and
strike the keynote of thy songs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sweet,&rdquo; and
didst thou find aught of sweet, when thou, like thy Daphnis,
didst &ldquo;go down the stream, when the whirling wave closed
over the man the Muses loved, the man not hated of the
Nymphs&rdquo;?&nbsp; Perchance below those waters of death thou
didst find, like thine own Hylas, the lovely Nereids waiting
thee, Eunice, and Malis, and Nycheia with her April eyes.&nbsp;
In the House of Hades, Theocritus, doth there dwell aught that is
fair, and can the low light on the fields of asphodel make thee
forget thy Sicily?&nbsp; Nay, methinks thou hast not forgotten,
and perchance for poets dead there is prepared a place more
beautiful than their dreams.&nbsp; It was well for the later
minstrels of another day, it was well for Ronsard and Du Bellay
to desire a dim Elysium of their own, where the sunlight comes
faintly through the shadow of the earth, where the poplars are
duskier, and the waters more pale than in the meadows of
Anjou.</p>
<p>There, in that restful twilight, far remote from war and plot,
from sword and fire, and from religions that sharpened the steel
and lit the torch, there these learned singers would fain have
wandered with their learned ladies, satiated with life and in
love with an unearthly quiet.&nbsp; But to thee, Theocritus, no
twilight of the Hollow Land was dear, but the high suns of Sicily
and the brown cheeks of the country maidens were happiness
enough.&nbsp; For thee, therefore, methinks, surely is reserved
an Elysium beneath the summer of a far-off system, with stars not
ours and alien seasons.&nbsp; There, as Bion prayed, shall
Spring, the thrice desirable, be with thee the whole year
through, where there is neither frost, nor is the heat so heavy
on men, but all is fruitful, and all sweet things blossom, and
evenly meted are darkness and dawn.&nbsp; Space is wide, and
there be many worlds, and suns enow, and the Sun-god surely has
had a care of his own.&nbsp; Little didst thou need, in thy
native land, the isle of the three capes, little didst thou need
but sunlight on land and sea.&nbsp; Death can have shown thee
naught dearer than the fragrant shadow of the pines, where the
dry needles of the fir are strewn, or glades where feathered
ferns make &ldquo;a couch more soft than Sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
short grass of the cliffs, too, thou didst love, where thou
wouldst lie, and watch, with the tunny watcher till the deep blue
sea was broken by the burnished sides of the tunny shoal, and
afoam with their gambols in the brine.&nbsp; There the Muses met
thee, and the Nymphs, and there Apollo, remembering his old
thraldom with Admetus, would lead once more a mortal&rsquo;s
flocks, and listen and learn, Theocritus, while thou, like thine
own Comatas, &ldquo;didst sweetly sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There, methinks, I see thee as in thy happy days,
&ldquo;reclined on deep beds of fragrant lentisk, lowly strewn,
and rejoicing in new stript leaves of the vine, while far above
thy head waved many a poplar, many an elm-tree, and close at hand
the sacred waters sang from the mouth of the cavern of the
nymphs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when night came, methinks thou wouldst
flee from the merry company and the dancing girls, from the
fading crowns of roses or white violets, from the cottabos, and
the minstrelsy, and the Bibline wine, from these thou wouldst
slip away into the summer night.&nbsp; Then the beauty of life
and of the summer would keep thee from thy couch, and wandering
away from Syracuse by the sandhills and the sea, thou wouldst
watch the low cabin, roofed with grass, where the fishing-rods of
reed were leaning against the door, while the Mediterranean
floated up her waves, and filled the waste with sound.&nbsp;
There didst thou see thine ancient fishermen rising ere the dawn
from their bed of dry seaweed, and heardst them stirring, drowsy,
among their fishing gear, and heardst them tell their dreams.</p>
<p>Or again thou wouldst wander with dusty feet through the ways
that the dust makes silent, while the breath of the kine, as they
were driven forth with the morning, came fresh to thee, and the
trailing dewy branch of honeysuckle struck sudden on thy
cheek.&nbsp; Thou wouldst see the Dawn awake in rose and saffron
across the waters, and Etna, grey and pale against the sky, and
the setting crescent would dip strangely in the glow, on her way
to the sea.&nbsp; Then, methinks, thou wouldst murmur, like thine
own Simaetha, the love-lorn witch, &ldquo;Farewell, Selene,
bright and fair; farewell, ye other stars, that follow the wheels
of the quiet Night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, surely it was in such an
hour that thou didst behold the girl as she burned the laurel
leaves and the barley grain, and melted the waxen image, and
called on Selene to bring her lover home.&nbsp; Even so, even
now, in the islands of Greece, the setting Moon may listen to the
prayers of maidens.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bright golden Moon, that now art
near the waters, go thou and salute my lover, he that stole my
love, and that kissed me, saying &ldquo;Never will I leave
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And lo, he hath left me as men leave a field
reaped and gleaned, like a church where none cometh to pray, like
a city desolate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the girls still sing in Greece, for though the Temples have
fallen, and the wandering shepherds sleep beneath the broken
columns of the god&rsquo;s house in Selinus, yet these ancient
fires burn still to the old divinities in the shrines of the
hearths of the peasants.&nbsp; It is none of the new creeds that
cry, in the dirge of the Sicilian shepherds of our time,
&ldquo;Ah, light of mine eyes, what gift shall I send thee, what
offering to the other world?&nbsp; The apple fadeth, the quince
decayeth, and one by one they perish, the petals of the
rose.&nbsp; I will send thee my tears shed on a napkin, and what
though it burneth in the flame, if my tears reach thee at the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, little is altered, Theocritus, on these shores beneath
the sun, where thou didst wear a tawny skin stripped from the
roughest of he-goats, and about thy breast an old cloak buckled
with a plaited belt.&nbsp; Thou wert happier there, in Sicily,
methinks, and among vines and shadowy lime-trees of Cos, than in
the dust, and heat, and noise of Alexandria.&nbsp; What love of
fame, what lust of gold tempted thee away from the red cliffs,
and grey olives, and wells of black water wreathed with
maidenhair?</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of
thy rustic flute<br />
Kept not for long its happy country tone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost it too soon, and learned a stormy note<br />
Of men contention tost, of men who groan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which tasked thy pipe too sore, and tired thy
throat&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It failed, and thou wast mute!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What hadst thou to make in cities, and what could Ptolemies
and Princes give thee better than the goat-milk cheese and the
Ptelean wine?&nbsp; Thy Muses were meant to be the delight of
peaceful men, not of tyrants and wealthy merchants, to whom they
vainly went on a begging errand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who will open his
door and gladly receive our Muses within his house, who is there
that will not send them back again without a gift?&nbsp; And they
with naked feet and looks askance come homewards, and sorely they
upbraid me when they have gone on a vain journey, and listless
again in the bottom of their empty coffer they dwell with heads
bowed over their chilly knees, where is their drear abode, when
portionless they return.&rdquo;&nbsp; How far happier was the
prisoned goat-herd, Comatas, in the fragrant cedar chest where
the blunt-faced bees from the meadow fed him with food of tender
flowers, because still the Muse dropped sweet nectar on his
lips!</p>
<p>Thou didst leave the neat-herds and the kine, and the oaks of
Himera, the galingale hummed over by the bees, and the pine that
dropped her cones, and Amaryllis in her cave, and Bombyca with
her feet of carven ivory.&nbsp; Thou soughtest the City, and
strife with other singers, and the learned write still on thy
quarrels with Apollonius and Callimachus, and Antagoras of
Rhodes.&nbsp; So ancient are the hatreds of poets, envy,
jealousy, and all unkindness.</p>
<p>Not to the wits of Courts couldst thou teach thy rural song,
though all these centuries, more than two thousand years, they
have laboured to vie with thee.&nbsp; There has come no new
pastoral poet, though Virgil copied thee, and Pope, and Phillips,
and all the buckram band of the teacup time; and all the modish
swains of France have sung against thee, as the <i>sow challenged
Athene</i>.&nbsp; They never knew the shepherd&rsquo;s life, the
long winter nights on dried heather by the fire, the long summer
days, when over the parched grass all is quiet, and only the
insects hum, and the shrunken burn whispers a silver tune.&nbsp;
Swains in high-heeled shoon, and lace, shepherdesses in rouge and
diamonds, the world is weary of all concerning them, save their
images in porcelain, effigies how unlike thy golden figures,
dedicate to Aphrodite, of Bombyca and Battus!&nbsp; Somewhat,
Theocritus, thou hast to answer for, thou that first of men
brought the shepherd to Court, and made courtiers wild to go a
Maying with the shepherds.</p>
<h2><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>XIV.<br />
<i>To Edgar Allan Poe</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your English readers,
better acquainted with your poems and romances than with your
criticisms, have long wondered at the indefatigable hatred which
pursues your memory.&nbsp; You, who knew the men, will not marvel
that certain microbes of letters, the survivors of your own
generation, still harass your name with their malevolence, while
old women twitter out their incredible and unheeded slanders in
the literary papers of New York.&nbsp; But their persistent
animosity does not quite suffice to explain the dislike with
which many American critics regard the greatest poet, perhaps the
greatest literary genius, of their country.&nbsp; With a
commendable patriotism, they are not apt to rate native merit too
low; and you, I think, are the only example of an American
prophet almost without honour in his own country.</p>
<p>The recent publication of a cold, careful, and in many
respects admirable study of your career (&ldquo;Edgar Allan
Poe,&rdquo; by George Woodberry: Houghton, Mifflin and Co.,
Boston) reminds English readers who have forgotten it, and
teaches those who never knew it, that you were, unfortunately, a
Reviewer.&nbsp; How unhappy were the necessities, how deplorable
the vein, that compelled or seduced a man of your eminence into
the dusty and stony ways of contemporary criticism!&nbsp; About
the writers of his own generation a leader of that generation
should hold his peace.&nbsp; He should neither praise nor blame
nor defend his equals; he should not strike one blow at the
buzzing ephemer&aelig; of letters.&nbsp; The breath of their life
is in the columns of &ldquo;Literary Gossip;&rdquo; and they
should be allowed to perish with the weekly advertisements on
which they pasture.&nbsp; Reviewing, of course, there must needs
be; but great minds should only criticise the great who have
passed beyond the reach of eulogy or fault-finding.</p>
<p>Unhappily, taste and circumstances combined to make you a
censor; you vexed a continent, and you are still
unforgiven.&nbsp; What &ldquo;irritation of a sensitive nature,
chafed by some indefinite sense of wrong,&rdquo; drove you (in
Mr. Longfellow&rsquo;s own words) to attack his pure and
beneficent Muse we may never ascertain.&nbsp; But Mr. Longfellow
forgave you easily; for pardon comes easily to the great.&nbsp;
It was the smaller men, the Daweses, Griswolds, and the like,
that knew not how to forget.&nbsp; &ldquo;The New Yorkers never
forgave him,&rdquo; says your latest biographer; and one scarcely
marvels at the inveteracy of their malice.&nbsp; It was not
individual vanity alone, but the whole literary class that you
assailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a literary people,&rdquo; you wrote,
&ldquo;we are one vast perambulating humbug.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
that declaration of war you died, and left your reputation to the
vanities yet writhing beneath your scorn.&nbsp; They are writhing
and writing still.&nbsp; He who knows them need not linger over
the attacks and defences of your personal character; he will not
waste time on calumnies, tale-bearing, private letters, and all
the noisome dust which takes so long in settling above your
tomb.</p>
<p>For us it is enough to know that you were compelled to live by
your pen, and that in an age when the author of &ldquo;To
Helen&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Cask of Amontillado&rdquo; was paid
at the rate of a dollar a column.&nbsp; When such poverty was the
mate of such pride as yours, a misery more deep than that of
Burns, an agony longer than Chatterton&rsquo;s, were inevitable
and assured.&nbsp; No man was less fortunate than you in the
moment of his birth&mdash;<i>infelix opportunitate
vit&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Had you lived a generation later, honour,
wealth, applause, success in Europe and at home, would all have
been yours.&nbsp; Within thirty years so great a change has
passed over the profession of letters in America; and it is
impossible to estimate the rewards which would have fallen to
Edgar Poe, had chance made him the contemporary of Mark Twain and
of &ldquo;Called Back.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be that your
criticisms helped to bring in the new era, and to lift letters
out of the reach of quite unlettered scribblers.&nbsp; Though not
a scholar, at least you had a respect for scholarship.&nbsp; You
might still marvel over such words as &ldquo;objectional&rdquo;
in the new biography of yourself, and might ask what is meant by
such a sentence as &ldquo;his connection with it had inured to
his own benefit by the frequent puffs of himself,&rdquo; and so
forth.</p>
<p>Best known in your own day as a critic, it is as a poet and a
writer of short tales that you must live.&nbsp; But to discuss
your few and elaborate poems is a waste of time, so completely
does your own brief definition of poetry, &ldquo;the rhythmic
creation of the beautiful,&rdquo; exhaust your theory, and so
perfectly is the theory illustrated by the poems.&nbsp; Natural
bent, and reaction against the example of Mr. Longfellow,
combined to make you too intolerant of what you call the
&ldquo;didactic&rdquo; element in verse.&nbsp; Even if morality
be not seven-eighths of our life (the exact proportion as at
present estimated), there was a place even on the Hellenic
Parnassus for gnomic bards, and theirs in the nature of the case
must always be the largest public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music is the perfection of the soul or the idea of
poetry,&rdquo; so you wrote; &ldquo;the vagueness of exaltation
aroused by a sweet air (which should be indefinite and never too
strongly suggestive) is precisely what we should aim at in
poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; You aimed at that mark, and struck it again
and again, notably in &ldquo;Helen, thy beauty is to me,&rdquo;
in &ldquo;The Haunted Palace,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Valley of
Unrest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The City in the Sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
by some Nemesis which might, perhaps, have been foreseen, you
are, to the world, the poet of one poem&mdash;&ldquo;The
Raven:&rdquo; a piece in which the music is highly artificial,
and the &ldquo;exaltation&rdquo; (what there is of it) by no
means particularly &ldquo;vague.&rdquo;&nbsp; So a portion of the
public know little of Shelley but the &ldquo;Skylark,&rdquo; and
those two incongruous birds, the lark and the raven, bear each of
them a poet&rsquo;s name, <i>vivu&rsquo; per ora virum</i>.&nbsp;
Your theory of poetry, if accepted, would make you (after the
author of &ldquo;Kubla Khan&rdquo;) the foremost of the poets of
the world; at no long distance would come Mr. William Morris as
he was when he wrote &ldquo;Golden Wings,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Blue
Closet,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Sailing of the Sword;&rdquo; and,
close up, Mr. Lear, the author of &ldquo;The Yongi Bongi
Bo,&rdquo; an the lay of the &ldquo;Jumblies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand Homer would sink into the limbo to which you
consigned Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; If we may judge a theory by its
results, when compared with the deliberate verdict of the world,
your &aelig;sthetic does not seem to hold water.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; is not really inferior to
&ldquo;Ulalume,&rdquo; as it ought to be if your doctrine of
poetry were correct, nor &ldquo;Le Festin de Pierre&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Undine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet you deserve the praise of having
been constant, in your poetic practice, to your poetic
principles&mdash;principles commonly deserted by poets who, like
Wordsworth, have published their &aelig;sthetic system.&nbsp;
Your pieces are few; and Dr. Johnson would have called you, like
Fielding, &ldquo;a barren rascal.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how can a
writer&rsquo;s verses be numerous if with him, as with you,
&ldquo;poetry is not a pursuit but a passion . . . which cannot
at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations or the
more paltry commendations of mankind!&rdquo;&nbsp; Of you it may
be said, more truly than Shelley said it of himself, that
&ldquo;to ask you for anything human, is like asking at a
gin-shop for a leg of mutton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humanity must always be, to the majority of men, the true
stuff of poetry; and only a minority will thank you for that rare
music which (like the strains of the fiddler in the story) is
touched on a single string, and on an instrument fashioned from
the spoils of the grave.&nbsp; You chose, or you were
destined</p>
<blockquote><p>To vary from the kindly race of men;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the consequences, which wasted your life, pursue your
reputation.</p>
<p>For your stories has been reserved a boundless popularity, and
that highest success&mdash;the success of a perfectly sympathetic
translation.&nbsp; By this time, of course, you have made the
acquaintance of your translator, M. Charles Baudelaire, who so
strenuously shared your views about Mr. Emerson and the
Transcendentalists, and who so energetically resisted all those
ideas of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; which &ldquo;came from Hell or
Boston.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this point, however, the world continues
to differ from you and M. Baudelaire, and perhaps there is only
the choice between our optimism and universal suicide or
universal opium-eating.&nbsp; But to discuss your ultimate ideas
is perhaps a profitless digression from the topic of your prose
romances.</p>
<p>An English critic (probably a Northerner at heart) has
described them as &ldquo;Hawthorne and delirium
tremens.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am not aware that extreme orderliness,
masterly elaboration, and unchecked progress towards a
predetermined effect are characteristics of the visions of
delirium.&nbsp; If they be, then there is a deal of truth in the
criticism, and a good deal of delirium tremens in your
style.&nbsp; But your ingenuity, your completeness, your
occasional luxuriance of fancy and wealth of jewel-like words,
are not, perhaps, gifts which Mr. Hawthorne had at his
command.&nbsp; He was a great writer&mdash;the greatest writer in
prose fiction whom America has produced.&nbsp; But you and he
have not much in common, except a certain mortuary turn of mind
and a taste for gloomy allegories about the workings of
conscience.</p>
<p>I forbear to anticipate your verdict about the latest essays
of American fiction.&nbsp; These by no means follow in the lines
which you laid down about brevity and the steady working to one
single effect.&nbsp; Probably you would not be very tolerant
(tolerance was not your leading virtue) of Mr. Roe, now your
countrymen&rsquo;s favourite novelist.&nbsp; He is long, he is
didactic, he is eminently uninspired.&nbsp; In the works of one
who is, what you were called yourself, a Bostonian, you would
admire, at least, the acute observation, the subtlety, and the
unfailing distinction.&nbsp; But, destitute of humour as you
unhappily but undeniably were, you would miss, I fear, the charm
of &ldquo;Daisy Miller.&rdquo;&nbsp; You would admit the unity of
effect secured in &ldquo;Washington Square,&rdquo; though that
effect is as remote as possible from the terror of &ldquo;The
House of Usher&rdquo; or the vindictive triumph of &ldquo;The
Cask of Amontillado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farewell, farewell, thou sombre and solitary spirit: a genius
tethered to the hack-work of the press, a gentleman among
<i>canaille</i>, a poet among poetasters, dowered with a
scholar&rsquo;s taste without a scholar&rsquo;s training,
embittered by his sensitive scorn, and all unsupported by his
consolations.</p>

<i>To Sir Walter Scott</i>, <i>Bart.</i></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Rodono, St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch:<br />
Sept. 8, 1885.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your biography it is
recorded that you not only won the favour of all men and women;
but that a domestic fowl conceived an affection for you, and that
a pig, by his will, had never been severed from your
company.&nbsp; If some Circe had repeated in my case her
favourite miracle of turning mortals into swine, and had given me
a choice, into that fortunate pig, blessed among his race, would
I have been converted!&nbsp; You, almost alone among men of
letters, still, like a living friend, win and charm us out of the
past; and if one might call up a poet, as the scholiast tried to
call Homer, from the shades, who would not, out of all the rest,
demand some hours of your society?&nbsp; Who that ever meddled
with letters, what child of the irritable race, possessed even a
tithe of your simple manliness, of the heart that never knew a
touch of jealousy, that envied no man his laurels, that took
honour and wealth as they came, but never would have deplored
them had you missed both and remained but the Border sportsman
and the Border antiquary?</p>
<p>Were the word &ldquo;genial&rdquo; not so much profaned, were
it not misused in easy good-nature, to extenuate lettered and
sensual indolence, that worn old term might be applied, above all
men, to &ldquo;the Shirra.&rdquo;&nbsp; But perhaps we scarcely
need a word (it would be seldom in use) for a character so rare,
or rather so lonely, in its nobility and charm as that of Walter
Scott.&nbsp; Here, in the heart of your own country, among your
own grey round-shouldered hills (each so like the other that the
shadow of one falling on its neighbour exactly outlines that
neighbour&rsquo;s shape), it is of you and of your works that a
native of the Forest is most frequently brought in mind.&nbsp;
All the spirits of the river and the hill, all the dying refrains
of ballad and the fading echoes of story, all the memory of the
wild past, each legend of burn and loch, seem to have combined to
inform your spirit, and to secure themselves an immortal life in
your song.&nbsp; It is through you that we remember them; and in
recalling them, as in treading each hillside in this land, we
again remember you and bless you.</p>
<p>It is not, &ldquo;Sixty Years Since&rdquo; the echo of Tweed
among his pebbles fell for the last time on your ear; not sixty
years since, and how much is altered!&nbsp; But two generations
have passed; the lad who used to ride from Edinburgh to
Abbotsford, carrying new books for you, and old, is still
vending, in George Street, old books and new.&nbsp; Of politics I
have not the heart to speak.&nbsp; Little joy would you have had
in most that has befallen since the Reform Bill was passed, to
the chivalrous cry of &ldquo;burke Sir Walter.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
are still very Radical in the Forest, and you were taken away
from many evils to come.&nbsp; How would the cheek of Walter
Scott, or of Leyden, have blushed at the names of Majuba, The
Soudan, Maiwand, and many others that recall political cowardice
or military incapacity!&nbsp; On the other hand, who but you
could have sung the dirge of Gordon, or wedded with immortal
verse the names of Hamilton (who fell with Cavagnari), of the two
Stewarts, of many another clansman, brave among the
bravest!&nbsp; Only he who told how</p>
<blockquote><p>The stubborn spearmen still made good<br />
Their dark impenetrable wood</p>
</blockquote>
<p>could have fitly rhymed a score of feats of arms in which, as
at M&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Zareba and at Abu Klea,</p>
<blockquote><p>Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fearlessly and well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, Sir, the hearts of the rulers may wax faint, and the
voting classes may forget that they are Britons; but when it
comes to blows our fighting men might cry, with Leyden,</p>
<blockquote><p>My name is little Jock Elliot,<br />
And wha daur meddle wi&rsquo; me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much is changed, in the countryside as well as in the country;
but much remains.&nbsp; The little towns of your time are
populous and excessively black with the smoke of
factories&mdash;not, I fear, at present very flourishing.&nbsp;
In Galashiels you still see the little change-house and the
cluster of cottages round the Laird&rsquo;s lodge, like the
clachan of Tully Veolan.&nbsp; But these plain remnants of the
old Scotch towns are almost buried in a multitude of &ldquo;smoky
dwarf houses&rdquo;&mdash;a living poet, Mr. Matthew Arnold, has
found the fitting phrase for these dwellings, once for all.&nbsp;
All over the Forest the waters are dirty and poisoned: I think
they are filthiest below Hawick; but this may be mere local
prejudice in a Selkirk man.&nbsp; To keep them clean costs money;
and, though improvements are often promised, I cannot see much
change&mdash;for the better.&nbsp; Abbotsford, luckily, is above
Galashiels, and only receives the dirt and dyes of Selkirk,
Peebles, Walkerburn, and Innerleithen.&nbsp; On the other hand,
your ill-omened later dwelling, &ldquo;the unhappy palace of your
race,&rdquo; is overlooked by villas that prick a cockney ear
among their larches, hotels of the future.&nbsp; Ah, Sir,
Scotland is a strange place.&nbsp; Whisky is exiled from some of
our caravanserais, and they have banished Sir John
Barleycorn.&nbsp; It seems as if the views of the excellent
critic (who wrote your life lately, and said you had left no
descendants, <i>le pauvre homme</i>!) were beginning to
prevail.&nbsp; This pious biographer was greatly shocked by that
capital story about the keg of whisky that arrived at the
Liddesdale farmer&rsquo;s during family prayers.&nbsp; Your
Toryism also was an offence to him.</p>
<p>Among these vicissitudes of things and the overthrow of
customs, let us be thankful that, beyond the reach of the
manufacturers, the Border country remains as kind and homely as
ever.&nbsp; I looked at Ashiestiel some days ago: the house
seemed just as it may have been when you left it for Abbotsford,
only there was a lawn-tennis net on the lawn, the hill on the
opposite bank of the Tweed was covered to the crest with turnips,
and the burn did not sing below the little bridge, for in this
arid summer the burn was dry.&nbsp; But there was still a grilse
that rose to a big March brown in the shrunken stream below
Elibank.&nbsp; This may not interest you, who styled yourself</p>
<blockquote><p>No fisher,<br />
But a well-wisher<br />
To the game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, as when you were thinking over Marmion, a man might
have &ldquo;grand gallops among the hills&rdquo;&mdash;those
grave wastes of heather and bent that sever all the watercourses
and roll their sheep-covered pastures from Dollar Law to White
Combe, and from White Combe to the Three Brethren Cairn and the
Windburg and Skelf-hill Pen.&nbsp; Yes, Teviotdale is pleasant
still, and there is not a drop of dye in the water, <i>purior
electro</i>, of Yarrow.&nbsp; St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch lies beneath
me, smitten with wind and rain&mdash;the St. Mary&rsquo;s of
North and of the Shepherd.&nbsp; Only the trout, that see a
myriad of artificial flies, are shyer than of yore.&nbsp; The
Shepherd could no longer fill a cart up Meggat with trout so much
of a size that the country people took them for herrings.</p>
<p>The grave of Piers Cockburn is still not desecrated: hard by
it lies, within a little wood; and beneath that slab of old
sandstone, and the graven letters, and the sword and shield,
sleep &ldquo;Piers Cockburn and Marjory his wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Not a hundred yards off was the castle-door where they hanged
him; this is the tomb of the ballad, and the lady that buried him
rests now with her wild lord.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, wat ye no my heart was sair,<br />
When I happit the mouls on his yellow hair;<br />
Oh, wat ye no my heart was wae,<br />
When I turned about and went my way! <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here too hearts have broken, and there is a sacredness in the
shadow and beneath these clustering berries of the
rowan-trees.&nbsp; That sacredness, that reverent memory of our
old land, it is always and inextricably blended with our
memories, with our thoughts, with our love of you.&nbsp;
Scotchmen, methinks, who owe so much to you, owe you most for the
example you gave of the beauty of a life of honour, showing them
what, by heaven&rsquo;s blessing, a Scotchman still might be.</p>
<p>Words, empty and unavailing&mdash;for what words of ours can
speak our thoughts or interpret our affections!&nbsp; From you
first, as we followed the deer with King James, or rode with
William of Deloraine on his midnight errand, did we learn what
Poetry means and all the happiness that is in the gift of
song.&nbsp; This and more than may be told you gave us, that are
not forgetful, not ungrateful, though our praise be unequal to
our gratitude.&nbsp; <i>Fungor inani munere</i>!</p>
<h2><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>XVI.<br />
<i>To Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</i>.<br />
(<span class="GutSmall">CONCERNING THE GODS OF THE
HEATHEN</span>.)</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Touching</span> the Gods of the Heathen,
most reverend Father, thou art not ignorant that even now, as in
the time of thy probation on earth, there is great
dissension.&nbsp; That these feigned Deities and idols, the work
of men&rsquo;s hands, are no longer worshipped thou knowest;
neither do men eat meat offered to idols.&nbsp; Even as spake
that last Oracle which murmured forth, the latest and the only
true voice from Delphi, even so &ldquo;the fair-wrought court
divine hath fallen; no more hath Phoebus his home, no more his
laurel-bough, nor the singing well of water; nay, the
sweet-voiced water is silent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fane is ruinous,
and the images of men&rsquo;s idolatry are dust.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most worshipful, men do still dispute about the
beginnings of those sinful Gods: such as Zeus, Athene, and
Dionysus: and marvel how first they won their dominion over the
souls of the foolish peoples.&nbsp; Now, concerning these things
there is not one belief, but many; howbeit, there are two main
kinds of opinion.&nbsp; One sect of philosophers
believes&mdash;as thyself, with heavenly learning, didst not
vainly persuade&mdash;that the Gods were the inventions of wild
and bestial folk, who, long before cities were builded or life
was honourably ordained, fashioned forth evil spirits in their
own savage likeness; ay, or in the likeness of the very beasts
that perish.&nbsp; To this judgment, as it is set forth in thy
Book of the Preparation for the Gospel, I, humble as I am, do
give my consent.&nbsp; But on the other side are many and learned
men, chiefly of the tribes of the Alemanni, who have almost
conquered the whole inhabited world.&nbsp; These, being unwilling
to suppose that the Hellenes were in bondage to superstitions
handed down from times of utter darkness and a bestial life, do
chiefly hold with the heathen philosophers, even with the writers
whom thou, most venerable, didst confound with thy wisdom and
chasten with the scourge of small cords of thy wit.</p>
<p>Thus, like the heathen, our doctors and teachers maintain that
the gods of the nations were, in the beginning, such pure natural
creatures as the blue sky, the sun, the air, the bright dawn, and
the fire; but, as time went on, men, forgetting the meaning of
their own speech and no longer understanding the tongue of their
own fathers, were misled and beguiled into fashioning all those
lamentable tales: as that Zeus, for love of mortal women, took
the shape of a bull, a ram, a serpent, an ant, an eagle, and
sinned in such wise as it is a shame even to speak of.</p>
<p>Behold, then, most worshipful, how these doctors and learned
men argue, even like the philosophers of the heathen whom thou
didst confound.&nbsp; For they declare the gods to have been
natural elements, sun and sky and storm, even as did thy
opponents; and, like them, as thou saidst, &ldquo;they are nowise
at one with each other in their explanations.&rdquo;&nbsp; For of
old some boasted that Hera was the Air; and some that she
signified the love of woman and man; and some that she was the
waters above the Earth; and others that she was the Earth beneath
the waters; and yet others that she was the Night, for that Night
is the shadow of Earth: as if, forsooth, the men who first
worshipped Hera had understanding of these things!&nbsp; And when
Hera and Zeus quarrel unseemly (as Homer declareth), this meant
(said the learned in thy days) no more than the strife and
confusion of the elements, and was not in the beginning an idle
slanderous tale.</p>
<p>To all which, most worshipful, thou didst answer wisely:
saying that Hera could not be both night, and earth, and water,
and air, and the love of sexes, and the confusion of the
elements; but that all these opinions were vain dreams, and the
guesses of the learned.&nbsp; And why&mdash;thou
saidst&mdash;even if the Gods were pure natural creatures, are
such foul things told of them in the Mysteries as it is not
fitting for me to declare.&nbsp; &ldquo;These wanderings, and
drinkings, and loves, and seductions, that would be shameful in
men, why,&rdquo; thou saidst, &ldquo;were they attributed to the
natural elements; and wherefore did the Gods constantly show
themselves, like the sorcerers called werewolves, in the shape of
the perishable beasts?&rdquo;&nbsp; But, mainly, thou didst argue
that, till the philosophers of the heathen were agreed among
themselves, not all contradicting each the other, they had no
semblance of a sure foundation for their doctrine.</p>
<p>To all this and more, most worshipful Father, I know not what
the heathen answered thee.&nbsp; But, in our time, the learned
men who stand to it that the heathen Gods were in the beginning
the pure elements, and that the nations, forgetting their first
love and the significance of their own speech, became confused
and were betrayed into foul stories about the pure
Gods&mdash;these learned men, I say, agree no whit among
themselves.&nbsp; Nay, they differ one from another, not less
than did Plutarch and Porphyry and Theagenes, and the rest whom
thou didst laugh to scorn.&nbsp; Bear with me, Father, while I
tell thee how the new Plutarchs and Porphyrys do contend among
themselves; and yet these differences of theirs they call
&ldquo;Science&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Consider the goddess Athene, who sprang armed from the head of
Zeus, even as&mdash;among the fables of the poor heathen folk of
seas thou never knewest&mdash;goddesses are fabled to leap out
from the armpits or feet of their fathers.&nbsp; Thou must know
that what Plato, in the &ldquo;Cratylus,&rdquo; made Socrates say
in jest, the learned among us practise in sad earnest.&nbsp; For,
when they wish to explain the nature of any God, they first
examine his name, and torment the letters thereof, arranging and
altering them according to their will, and flying off to the
speech of the Indians and Medes and Chaldeans, and other
Barbarians, if Greek will not serve their turn.&nbsp; How saith
Socrates?&nbsp; &ldquo;I bethink me of a very new and ingenious
idea that occurs to me; and, if I do not mind, I shall be wiser
than I should be by to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn.&nbsp; My notion is
that we may put in and pull out letters at pleasure and alter the
accents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so do the learned&mdash;not at pleasure, maybe, but
according to certain fixed laws (so they declare); yet none the
more do they agree among themselves.&nbsp; And I deny not that
they discover many things true and good to be known; but, as
touching the names of the Gods, their learning, as it standeth,
is confusion.&nbsp; Look, then, at the goddess Athene: taking one
example out of hundreds.&nbsp; We have dwelling in our coasts
Muellerus, the most erudite of the doctors of the Alemanni, and
the most golden-mouthed.&nbsp; Concerning Athene, he saith that
her name is none other than, in the ancient tongue of the
Brachman&aelig;, <i>Ahan&acirc;</i>, which, being interpreted,
means the Dawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that the morning light,&rdquo;
saith he, &ldquo;offers the best starting-point for the later
growth of Athene has been proved, I believe, beyond the reach of
doubt or even cavil.&rdquo; <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a></p>
<p>Yet this same doctor candidly lets us know that another of his
nation, the witty Benfeius, hath devised another sense and origin
of Athene, taken from the speech of the old Medes.&nbsp; But
Muellerus declares to us that whosoever shall examine the
contention of Benfeius &ldquo;will be bound, in common honesty,
to confess that it is untenable.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, Father, is
&ldquo;one for Benfeius,&rdquo; as the saying goes.&nbsp; And as
Muellerus holds that these matters &ldquo;admit of almost
mathematical precision,&rdquo; it would seem that Benfeius is but
a <i>Dummkopf</i>, as the Alemanni say, in their own language,
when they would be pleasant among themselves.</p>
<p>Now, wouldst thou credit it? despite the mathematical
plainness of the facts, other Alemanni agree neither with
Muellerus, nor yet with Benfeius, and will neither hear that
Athene was the Dawn, nor yet that she is &ldquo;the feminine of
the Zend <i>Thr&acirc;et&acirc;na
athwy&acirc;na</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lo, you! how Prellerus goes
about to show that her name is drawn not from <i>Ahan&acirc;</i>
and the old Brachman&aelig;, nor <i>athwy&acirc;na</i> and the
old Medes, but from &ldquo;the root <i>&alpha;&#7984;&theta;</i>,
whence <i>&alpha;&#7988;&theta;&eta;&rho;</i>, the air, or
<i>&#7936;&theta;</i>, whence
<i>&#7940;&nu;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>, a
flower.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, and Prellerus will have it that no man
knows the verity of this matter.&nbsp; None the less he is very
bold, and will none of the Dawn; but holds to it that Athene was,
from the first, &ldquo;the clear pure height of the Air, which is
exceeding pure in Attica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Father, as if all this were not enough, comes one
Roscherus in, with a mighty great volume on the Gods, and
Furtwaenglerus, among others, for his ally.&nbsp; And these
doctors will neither with Rueckertus and Hermannus, take Athene
for &ldquo;wisdom in person;&rdquo; nor with Welckerus and
Prellerus, for &ldquo;the goddess of air;&rdquo; nor even, with
Muellerus and mathematical certainty, for &ldquo;the
Morning-Red:&rdquo; but they say that Athene is the &ldquo;black
thunder-cloud, and the lightning that leapeth
therefrom&rdquo;!&nbsp; I make no doubt that other Alemanni are
of other minds: <i>quot Alemanni tot sententi&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>Yea, as thou saidst of the learned heathen,
<i>&Omicron;&#8016;&delta;&#8050; &gamma;&#8048;&rho;
&#7936;&lambda;&lambda;&#942;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&#973;&mu;&phi;&omega;&nu;&alpha;
&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&#8166;&sigma;&iota;&nu;</i>.&nbsp;
Yet these disputes of theirs they call
&ldquo;Science&rdquo;!&nbsp; But if any man says to the learned:
&ldquo;Best of men, you are erudite, and laborious and witty;
but, till you are more of the same mind, your opinions cannot be
styled knowledge.&nbsp; Nay, they are at present of no avail
whereon to found any doctrine concerning the
Gods&rdquo;&mdash;that man is railed at for his
&ldquo;mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak&rdquo; arguments.</p>
<p>Was it thus, Father, that the heathen railed against
thee?&nbsp; But I must still believe, with thee, that these evil
tales of the Gods were invented &ldquo;when man&rsquo;s life was
yet brutish and wandering&rdquo; (as is the life of many tribes
that even now tell like tales), and were maintained in honour by
the later Greeks &ldquo;because none dared alter the ancient
beliefs of his ancestors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Farewell, Father; and all
good be with thee, wishes thy well-wisher and thy disciple.</p>

173</span>XVII.<br />
<i>To Percy Bysshe Shelley</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your lifetime on
earth you were not more than commonly curious as to what was said
by &ldquo;the herd of mankind,&rdquo; if I may quote your own
phrase.&nbsp; It was that of one who loved his fellow-men, but
did not in his less enthusiastic moments overestimate their
virtues and their discretion.&nbsp; Removed so far away from our
hubbub, and that world where, as you say, we &ldquo;pursue our
serious folly as of old,&rdquo; you are, one may guess, but
moderately concerned about the fate of your writings and your
reputation.&nbsp; As to the first, you have somewhere said, in
one of your letters, that the final judgment on your merits as a
poet is in the hands of posterity, and that you fear the verdict
will be &ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; and the sentence
&ldquo;Death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such apprehensions cannot have been
fixed or frequent in the mind of one whose genius burned always
with a clearer and steadier flame to the last.&nbsp; The jury of
which you spoke has met: a mixed jury and a merciful.&nbsp; The
verdict is &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; and the sentence Immortality
of Fame.&nbsp; There have been, there are, dissenters; yet
probably they will be less and less heard as the years go on.</p>
<p>One judge, or juryman, has made up his mind that prose was
your true province, and that your letters will out-live your
lays.&nbsp; I know not whether it was the same or an equally
well-inspired critic, who spoke of your most perfect lyrics (so
Beau Brummell spoke of his ill-tied cravats) as &ldquo;a gallery
of your failures.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the general voice does not
echo these utterances of a too subtle intellect.&nbsp; At a
famous University (not your own) once existed a band of men known
as &ldquo;The Trinity Sniffers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the spirit
of the sniffer may still inspire some of the jurors who from time
to time make themselves heard in your case.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Quarterly Review,&rdquo; I fear, is still
unreconciled.&nbsp; It regards your attempts as tainted by the
spirit of &ldquo;The Liberal Movement in English
Literature;&rdquo; and it is impossible, alas! to maintain with
any success that you were a Throne and Altar Tory.&nbsp; At
Oxford you are forgiven; and the old rooms where you let the
oysters burn (was not your founder, King Alfred, once guilty of
similar negligence?) are now shown to pious pilgrims.</p>
<p>But Conservatives, &rsquo;tis rumoured, are still averse to
your opinions, and are believed to prefer to yours the works of
the Reverend Mr. Keble, and, indeed, of the clergy in
general.&nbsp; But, in spite of all this, your poems, like the
affections of the true lovers in Theocritus, are yet &ldquo;in
the mouths of all, and chiefly on the lips of the
young.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in your lyrics that you live, and I do
not mean that every one could pass an examination in the plot of
&ldquo;Prometheus Unbound.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talking of this piece, by
the way, a Cambridge critic finds that it reveals in you a
hankering after life in a cave&mdash;doubtless an unconsciously
inherited memory from cave-man.&nbsp; Speaking of cave-man
reminds me that you once spoke of deserting song for prose, and
of producing a history of the moral, intellectual, and political
elements in human society, which, we now agree, began, as Asia
would fain have ended, in a cave.</p>
<p>Fortunately you gave us &ldquo;Adonais&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hellas&rdquo; instead of this treatise, and we have now
successfully written the natural history of Man for
ourselves.&nbsp; Science tells us that before becoming a
cave-dweller he was a Brute; Experience daily proclaims that he
constantly reverts to his original condition.&nbsp;
<i>L&rsquo;homme est un m&eacute;chant animal</i>, in spite of
your boyish efforts to add pretty girls &ldquo;to the list of the
good, the disinterested, and the free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, not in the wastes of Speculation, nor the sterile din of
Politics, were &ldquo;the haunts meet for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Watching the yellow bees in the ivy bloom, and the reflected pine
forest in the water-pools, watching the sunset as it faded, and
the dawn as it fired, and weaving all fair and fleeting things
into a tissue where light and music were at one, that was the
task of Shelley!&nbsp; &ldquo;To ask you for anything
human,&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;was like asking for a leg of
mutton at a gin-shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, rather, like asking
Apollo and Hebe, in the Olympian abodes, to give us beef for
ambrosia, and port for nectar.&nbsp; Each poet gives what he has,
and what he can offer; you spread before us fairy bread, and
enchanted wine, and shall we turn away, with a sneer, because,
out of all the multitudes of singers, one is spiritual and
strange, one has seen Artemis unveiled?&nbsp; One, like Anchises,
has been beloved of the Goddess, and his eyes, when he looks on
the common world of common men, are, like the eyes of Anchises,
blind with excess of light.&nbsp; Let Shelley sing of what he
saw, what none saw but Shelley!</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the popularity of your poems (the most
romantic of things didactic), our world is no better than the
world you knew.&nbsp; This will disappoint you, who had &ldquo;a
passion for reforming it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kings and priests are very
much where you left them.&nbsp; True, we have a poet who assails
them, at large, frequently and fearlessly; yet Mr. Swinburne has
never, like &ldquo;kind Hunt,&rdquo; been in prison, nor do we
fear for him a charge of treason.&nbsp; Moreover, chemical
science has discovered new and ingenious ways of destroying
principalities and powers.&nbsp; You would be interested in the
methods, but your peaceful Revolutionism, which disdained
physical force, would regret their application.</p>
<p>Our foreign affairs are not in a state which even you would
consider satisfactory; for we have just had to contend with a
Revolt of Islam, and we still find in Russia exactly the
qualities which you recognised and described.&nbsp; We have a
great statesman whose methods and eloquence somewhat resemble
those you attribute to Laon and Prince Athanase.&nbsp; Alas! he
is a youth of more than seventy summers; and not in his time will
Prometheus retire to a cavern and pass a peaceful millennium in
twining buds and beams.</p>
<p>In domestic affairs most of the Reforms you desired to see
have been carried.&nbsp; Ireland has received Emancipation, and
almost everything else she can ask for.&nbsp; I regret to say
that she is still unhappy; her wounds unstanched, her wrongs
unforgiven.&nbsp; At home we have enfranchised the paupers, and
expect the most happy results.&nbsp; Paupers (as Mr. Gladstone
says) are &ldquo;our own flesh and blood,&rdquo; and, as we
compel them to be vaccinated, so we should permit them to
vote.&nbsp; Is it a dream that Mr. Jesse Collings (how you would
have loved that man!) has a Bill for extending the priceless boon
of the vote to inmates of Pauper Lunatic Asylums?&nbsp; This may
prove that last element in the Elixir of political happiness
which we have long sought in vain.&nbsp; Atheists, you will
regret to hear, are still unpopular; but the new Parliament has
done something for Mr. Bradlaugh.&nbsp; You should have known our
Charles while you were in the &ldquo;Queen Mab&rdquo;
stage.&nbsp; I fear you wandered, later, from his robust
condition of intellectual development.</p>
<p>As to your private life, many biographers contrive to make
public as much of it as possible.&nbsp; Your name, even in life,
was, alas! a kind of <i>ducdame</i> to bring people of no very
great sense into your circle.&nbsp; This curious fascination has
attracted round your memory a feeble folk of commentators,
biographers, anecdotists, and others of the tribe.&nbsp; They
swarm round you like carrion-flies round a sensitive plant, like
night-birds bewildered by the sun.&nbsp; Men of sense and taste
have written on you, indeed; but your weaker admirers are now
disputing as to whether it was your heart, or a less dignified
and most troublesome organ, which escaped the flames of the
funeral pyre.&nbsp; These biographers fight terribly among
themselves, and vainly prolong the memory of &ldquo;old unhappy
far-off things, and sorrows long ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us leave
them and their squabbles over what is unessential, their raking
up of old letters and old stories.</p>
<p>The town has lately yawned a weary laugh over an enemy of
yours, who has produced two heavy volumes, styled by him
&ldquo;The Real Shelley.&rdquo;&nbsp; The real Shelley, it
appears, was Shelley as conceived of by a worthy gentleman so
prejudiced and so skilled in taking up things by the wrong handle
that I wonder he has not made a name in the exact science of
Comparative Mythology.&nbsp; He criticises you in the spirit of
that Christian Apologist, the Englishman who called you &ldquo;a
damned Atheist&rdquo; in the post-office at Pisa.&nbsp; He finds
that you had &ldquo;a little turned-up nose,&rdquo; a feature no
less important in his system than was the nose of Cleopatra
(according to Pascal) in the history of the world.&nbsp; To be in
harmony with your nose, you were a &ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo; liar,
an ill-bred, ill-born, profligate, partly insane, an
evil-tempered monster, a self-righteous person, full of
self-approbation&mdash;in fact you were the Beast of this pious
Apocalypse.&nbsp; Your friend Dr. Lind was an embittered and
scurrilous apothecary, &ldquo;a bad old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
enough of this inopportune brawler.</p>
<p>For Humanity, of which you hoped such great things, Science
predicts extinction in a night of Frost.&nbsp; The sun will grow
cold, slowly&mdash;as slowly as doom came on Jupiter in your
&ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; but as surely.&nbsp; If this nightmare
be fulfilled, perhaps the Last Man, in some fetid hut on the
ice-bound Equator, will read, by a fading lamp charged with the
dregs of the oil in his cruse, the poetry of Shelley.&nbsp; So
reading, he, the latest of his race, will not wholly be deprived
of those sights which alone (says the nameless Greek) make life
worth enduring.&nbsp; In your verse he will have sight of sky,
and sea, and cloud, the gold of dawn and the gloom of earthquake
and eclipse.&nbsp; He will be face to face, in fancy, with the
great powers that are dead, sun, and ocean, and the illimitable
azure of the heavens.&nbsp; In Shelley&rsquo;s poetry, while Man
endures, all those will survive; for your &ldquo;voice is as the
voice of winds and tides,&rdquo; and perhaps more deathless than
all of these, and only perishable with the perishing of the human
spirit.</p>
<h2><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>XVIII.<br />
<i>To Monsieur de Moli&egrave;re</i>, <i>Valet de Chambre du
Roi</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;With what awe does
a writer venture into the presence of the great
Moli&egrave;re!&nbsp; As a courtier in your time would scratch
humbly (with his comb!) at the door of the Grand Monarch, so I
presume to draw near your dwelling among the Immortals.&nbsp;
You, like the king who, among all his titles, has now none so
proud as that of the friend of Moli&egrave;re&mdash;you found
your dominions small, humble, and distracted; you raised them to
the dignity of an empire: what Louis XIV. did for France you
achieved for French comedy; and the baton of Scapin still wields
its sway though the sword of Louis was broken at Blenheim.&nbsp;
For the King the Pyrenees, or so he fancied, ceased to exist; by
a more magnificent conquest you overcame the Channel.&nbsp; If
England vanquished your country&rsquo;s arms, it was through you
that France <i>ferum victorem cepit</i>, and restored the dynasty
of Comedy to the land whence she had been driven.&nbsp; Ever
since Dryden borrowed &ldquo;L&rsquo;Etourdi,&rdquo; our tardy
apish nation has lived (in matters theatrical) on the spoils of
the wits of France.</p>
<p>In one respect, to be sure, times and manners have
altered.&nbsp; While you lived, taste kept the French drama pure;
and it was the congenial business of English playwrights to foist
their rustic grossness and their large Fescennine jests into the
urban page of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Now they are diversely
occupied; and it is their affair to lend modesty where they
borrow wit, and to spare a blush to the cheek of the Lord
Chamberlain.&nbsp; But still, as has ever been our wont since
Etherege saw, and envied, and imitated your successes&mdash;still
we pilfer the plays of France, and take our <i>bien</i>, as you
said in your lordly manner, wherever we can find it.&nbsp; We are
the privateers of the stage; and it is rarely, to be sure, that a
comedy pleases the town which has not first been &ldquo;cut
out&rdquo; from the countrymen of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Why this
should be, and what &ldquo;tenebriferous star&rdquo; (as
Paracelsus, your companion in the &ldquo;Dialogues des
Morts,&rdquo; would have believed) thus darkens the sun of
English humour, we know not; but certainly our dependence on
France is the sincerest tribute to you.&nbsp; Without you,
neither Rotrou, nor Corneille, nor &ldquo;a wilderness of
monkeys&rdquo; like Scarron, could ever have given Comedy to
France and restored her to Europe.</p>
<p>While we owe to you, Monsieur, the beautiful advent of Comedy,
fair and beneficent as Peace in the play of Aristophanes, it is
still to you that we must turn when of comedies we desire the
best.&nbsp; If you studied with daily and nightly care the works
of Plautus and Terence, if you &ldquo;let no musty <i>bouquin</i>
escape you&rdquo; (so your enemies declared), it was to some
purpose that you laboured.&nbsp; Shakespeare excepted, you
eclipsed all who came before you; and from those that follow,
however fresh, we turn: we turn from Regnard and Beaumarchais,
from Sheridan and Goldsmith, from Musset and Pailleron and
Labiche, to that crowded world of your creations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Creations&rdquo; one may well say, for you anticipated
Nature herself: you gave us, before she did, in Alceste a
Rousseau who was a gentleman not a lacquey; in a <i>mot</i> of
Don Juan&rsquo;s, the secret of the new Religion and the
watchword of Comte, <i>l&rsquo;amour de
l&rsquo;humanit&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Before you where can we find, save in Rabelais, a Frenchman
with humour; and where, unless it be in Montaigne, the wise
philosophy of a secular civilisation?&nbsp; With a heart the most
tender, delicate, loving, and generous, a heart often in agony
and torment, you had to make life endurable (we cannot doubt it)
without any whisper of promise, or hope, or warning from
Religion.&nbsp; Yes, in an age when the greatest mind of all, the
mind of Pascal, proclaimed that the only help was in voluntary
blindness, that the only chance was to hazard all on a bet at
evens, you, Monsieur, refused to be blinded, or to pretend to see
what you found invisible.</p>
<p>In Religion you beheld no promise of help.&nbsp; When the
Jesuits and Jansenists of your time saw, each of them, in Tartufe
the portrait of their rivals (as each of the laughable Marquises
in your play conceived that you were girding at his neighbour),
you all the while were mocking every credulous excess of
Faith.&nbsp; In the sermons preached to Agn&egrave;s we surely
hear your private laughter; in the arguments for credulity which
are presented to Don Juan by his valet we listen to the eternal
self-defence of superstition.&nbsp; Thus, desolate of belief, you
sought for the permanent element of life&mdash;precisely where
Pascal recognised all that was most fleeting and
unsubstantial&mdash;in <i>divertissement</i>; in the pleasure of
looking on, a spectator of the accidents of existence, an
observer of the follies of mankind.&nbsp; Like the Gods of the
Epicurean, you seem to regard our life as a play that is played,
as a comedy; yet how often the tragic note comes in!&nbsp; What
pity, and in the laughter what an accent of tears, as of rain in
the wind!&nbsp; No comedian has been so kindly and human as you;
none has had a heart, like you, to feel for his butts, and to
leave them sometimes, in a sense, superior to their
tormentors.&nbsp; Sganarelle, M. de Pourceaugnac, George Dandin,
and the rest&mdash;our sympathy, somehow, is with them, after
all; and M. de Pourceaugnac is a gentleman, despite his
misadventures.</p>
<p>Though triumphant Youth and malicious Love in your plays may
batter and defeat Jealousy and Old Age, yet they have not all the
victory, or you did not mean that they should win it.&nbsp; They
go off with laughter, and their victim with a grimace; but in him
we, that are past our youth, behold an actor in an unending
tragedy, the defeat of a generation.&nbsp; Your sympathy is not
wholly with the dogs that are having their day; you can throw a
bone or a crust to the dog that has had his, and has been taught
that it is over and ended.&nbsp; Yourself not unlearned in shame,
in jealousy, in endurance of the wanton pride of men (how could
the poor player and the husband of C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne be
untaught in that experience?), you never sided quite heartily, as
other comedians have done, with young prosperity and rank and
power.</p>
<p>I am not the first who has dared to approach you in the
Shades; for just after your own death the author of &ldquo;Les
Dialogues des Morts&rdquo; gave you Paracelsus as a companion,
and the author of &ldquo;Le Jugement de Pluton&rdquo; made the
&ldquo;mighty warder&rdquo; decide that &ldquo;Moli&egrave;re
should not talk philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp; These writers, like most
of us, feel that, after all, the comedies of the
<i>Contemplateur</i>, of the translator of Lucretius, are a
philosophy of life in themselves, and that in them we read the
lessons of human experience writ small and clear.</p>
<p>What comedian but Moli&egrave;re has combined with such
depths&mdash;with the indignation of Alceste, the self-deception
of Tartufe, the blasphemy of Don Juan&mdash;such wildness of
irresponsible mirth, such humour, such wit!&nbsp; Even now, when
more than two hundred years have sped by, when so much water has
flowed under the bridges and has borne away so many trifles of
contemporary mirth (<i>cetera fluminis ritu feruntur</i>), even
now we never laugh so well as when Mascarille and Vadius and M.
Jourdain tread the boards in the Maison de Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp;
Since those mobile dark brows of yours ceased to make men laugh,
since your voice denounced the &ldquo;demoniac&rdquo; manner of
contemporary tragedians, I take leave to think that no player has
been more worthy to wear the canons of Mascarille or the gown of
Vadius than M. Coquelin of the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise.&nbsp; In him you have a successor to your
Mascarille so perfect, that the ghosts of playgoers of your date
might cry, could they see him, that Moli&egrave;re had come
again.&nbsp; But, with all respect to the efforts of the fair, I
doubt if Mdlle. Barthet, or Mdme. Croizette herself, would
reconcile the town to the loss of the fair De Brie, and
Madeleine, and the first, the true C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne,
Armande.&nbsp; Yet had you ever so merry a <i>soubrette</i> as
Mdme. Samary, so exquisite a Nicole?</p>
<p>Denounced, persecuted, and buried hugger-mugger two hundred
years ago, you are now not over-praised, but more worshipped,
with more servility and ostentation, studied with more prying
curiosity than you may approve.&nbsp; Are not the
Moli&egrave;ristes a body who carry adoration to
fanaticism?&nbsp; Any scrap of your handwriting (so few are
these), any anecdote even remotely touching on your life, any
fact that may prove your house was numbered 15 not 22, is eagerly
seized and discussed by your too minute historians.&nbsp;
Concerning your private life, these men often speak more like
malicious enemies than friends; repeating the fabulous scandals
of Le Boulanger, and trying vainly to support them by grubbing in
dusty parish registers.&nbsp; It is most necessary to defend you
from your friends&mdash;from such friends as the veteran and
inveterate M. Ars&egrave;ne Houssaye, or the industrious but
puzzle-headed M. Loiseleur.&nbsp; Truly they seek the living
among the dead, and the immortal Moli&egrave;re among the
sweepings of attorneys&rsquo; offices.&nbsp; As I regard them
(for I have tarried in their tents) and as I behold their
trivialities&mdash;the exercises of men who neglect
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s works to gossip about
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s great-grand-mother&rsquo;s second-best
bed&mdash;I sometimes wish that Moli&egrave;re were here to write
on his devotees a new comedy, &ldquo;Les
Moli&egrave;ristes.&rdquo;&nbsp; How fortunate were they,
Monsieur, who lived and worked with you, who saw you day by day,
who were attached, as Lagrange tells us, by the kindest loyalty
to the best and most honourable of men, the most open-handed in
friendship, in charity the most delicate, of the heartiest
sympathy!&nbsp; Ah, that for one day I could behold you, writing
in the study, rehearsing on the stage, musing in the
lace-seller&rsquo;s shop, strolling through the Palais, turning
over the new books at Billaine&rsquo;s, dusting your ruffles
among the old volumes on the sunny stalls.&nbsp; Would that,
through the ages, we could hear you after supper, merry with
Boileau, and with Racine,&mdash;not yet a traitor,&mdash;laughing
over Chapelain, combining to gird at him in an epigram, or
mocking at Cotin, or talking your favourite philosophy, mindful
of Descartes.&nbsp; Surely of all the wits none was ever so good
a man, none ever made life so rich with humour and
friendship.</p>
<h2><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<i>To Robert Burns</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Among men of Genius, and
especially among Poets, there are some to whom we turn with a
peculiar and unfeigned affection; there are others whom we admire
rather than love.&nbsp; By some we are won with our will, by
others conquered against our desire.&nbsp; It has been your
peculiar fortune to capture the hearts of a whole people&mdash;a
people not usually prone to praise, but devoted with a personal
and patriotic loyalty to you and to your reputation.&nbsp; In you
every Scot who <i>is</i> a Scot sees, admires, and compliments
Himself, his ideal self&mdash;independent, fond of whisky, fonder
of the lassies; you are the true representative of him and of his
nation.&nbsp; Next year will be the hundredth since the press of
Kilmarnock brought to light its solitary masterpiece, your Poems;
and next year, therefore, methinks, the revenue will receive a
welcome accession from the abundance of whisky drunk in your
honour.&nbsp; It is a cruel thing for any of your countrymen to
feel that, where all the rest love, he can only admire; where all
the rest are idolators, he may not bend the knee; but stands
apart and beats upon his breast, observing, not adoring&mdash;a
critic.&nbsp; Yet to some of us&mdash;petty souls, perhaps, and
envious&mdash;that loud indiscriminating praise of &ldquo;Robbie
Burns&rdquo; (for so they style you in their Change-house
familiarity) has long been ungrateful; and, among the treasures
of your songs, we venture to select and even to reject.&nbsp; So
it must be!&nbsp; We cannot all love Haggis, nor &ldquo;painch,
tripe, and thairm,&rdquo; and all those rural dainties which you
celebrate as &ldquo;warm-reekin, rich!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather
too rich,&rdquo; as the Young Lady said on an occasion recorded
by Sam Weller.</p>
<blockquote><p>Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That jaups in luggies;<br />
But, if ye wish her gratefu&rsquo; prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gie her a Haggis!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You <i>have</i> given her a Haggis, with a vengeance, and her
&ldquo;gratefu&rsquo; prayer&rdquo; is yours for ever.&nbsp; But
if even an eternity of partridge may pall on the epicure, so of
Haggis too, as of all earthly delights, cometh satiety at
last.&nbsp; And yet what a glorious Haggis it is&mdash;the more
emphatically rustic and even Fescennine part of your verse!&nbsp;
We have had many a rural bard since Theocritus &ldquo;watched the
visionary flocks,&rdquo; but you are the only one of them all who
has spoken the sincere Doric.&nbsp; Yours is the talk of the byre
and the plough-tail; yours is that large utterance of the early
hinds.&nbsp; Even Theocritus minces matters, save where Lacon and
Comatas quite out-do the swains of Ayrshire.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
thee, Theocritus, wha matches?&rdquo; you ask, and yourself
out-match him in this wide rude region, trodden only by the rural
Muse.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Thy</i> rural loves are nature&rsquo;s
sel&rsquo;;&rdquo; and the wooer of Jean Armour speaks more like
a true shepherd than the elegant Daphnis of the
&ldquo;Oaristys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed it is with this that moral critics of your life
reproach you, forgetting, perhaps, that in your amours you were
but as other Scotch ploughmen and shepherds of the past and
present.&nbsp; Ettrick may still, with Afghanistan, offer matter
for idylls, as Mr. Carlyle (your antithesis, and the complement
of the Scotch character) supposed; but the morals of Ettrick are
those of rural Sicily in old days, or of Mossgiel in your
days.&nbsp; Over these matters the Kirk, with all her power, and
the Free Kirk too, have had absolutely no influence
whatever.&nbsp; To leave so delicate a topic, you were but as
other swains, or, as &ldquo;that Birkie ca&rsquo;d a lord,&rdquo;
Lord Byron; only you combined (in certain of your letters) a
libertine theory with your practice; you poured out in song your
audacious raptures, your half-hearted repentance, your shame and
your scorn.&nbsp; You spoke the truth about rural lives and
loves.&nbsp; We may like it or dislike it but we cannot deny the
verity.</p>
<p>Was it not as unhappy a thing, Sir, for you, as it was
fortunate for Letters and for Scotland, that you were born at the
meeting of two ages and of two worlds&mdash;precisely in the
moment when bookish literature was beginning to reach the people,
and when Society was first learning to admit the low-born to her
Minor Mysteries?&nbsp; Before you how many singers not less truly
poets than yourself&mdash;though less versatile not less
passionate, though less sensuous not less simple&mdash;had been
born and had died in poor men&rsquo;s cottages!&nbsp; There
abides not even the shadow of a name of the old Scotch
song-smiths, of the old ballad-makers.&nbsp; The authors of
&ldquo;Clerk Saunders,&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Wife of Usher&rsquo;s
Well,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Fair Annie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sir Patrick
Spens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bonny Hind,&rdquo; are as unknown to
us as Homer, whom in their directness and force they
resemble.&nbsp; They never, perhaps, gave their poems to writing;
certainly they never gave them to the press.&nbsp; On the lips
and in the hearts of the people they have their lives; and the
singers, after a life obscure and untroubled by society or by
fame, are forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Iniquity of Oblivion
blindly scattereth his Poppy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had you been born some years earlier you would have been even
as these unnamed Immortals, leaving great verses to a little
clan&mdash;verses retained only by Memory.&nbsp; You would have
been but the minstrel of your native valley: the wider world
would not have known you, nor you the world.&nbsp; Great thoughts
of independence and revolt would never have burned in you;
indignation would not have vexed you.&nbsp; Society would not
have given and denied her caresses.&nbsp; You would have been
happy.&nbsp; Your songs would have lingered in all &ldquo;the
circle of the summer hills;&rdquo; and your scorn, your satire,
your narrative verse, would have been unwritten or unknown.&nbsp;
To the world what a loss! and what a gain to you!&nbsp; We should
have possessed but a few of your lyrics, as</p>
<blockquote><p>When o&rsquo;er the hill the eastern star<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells bughtin-time is near, my jo;<br />
And owsen frae the furrowed field,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Return sae dowf and wearie O!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How noble that is, how natural, how unconsciously Greek!&nbsp;
You found, oddly, in good Mrs. Barbauld, the merits of the Tenth
Muse:</p>
<blockquote><p>In thy sweet sang, Barbauld, survives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Sappho&rsquo;s flame!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how unconsciously you remind us both of Sappho and of
Homer in these strains about the Evening Star and the hour when
the Day
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&nu;&#8055;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;

&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&upsilon;&tau;&#8057;&nu;&delta;&epsilon;?&nbsp;
Had you lived and died the pastoral poet of some silent glen,
such lyrics could not but have survived; free, too, of all that
in your songs reminds us of the Poet&rsquo;s Corner in the
&ldquo;Kirkcudbright Advertiser.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should not have
read how</p>
<blockquote><p>Ph&oelig;bus, gilding the brow o&rsquo;
morning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banishes ilk darksome shade!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still we might keep a love-poem unexcelled by Catullus,</p>
<blockquote><p>Had we never loved sae kindly,<br />
Had we never loved sae blindly,<br />
Never met&mdash;or never parted,<br />
We had ne&rsquo;er been broken-hearted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the letters to Clarinda would have been unwritten, and the
thrush would have been untaught in &ldquo;the style of the Bird
of Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quiet life of song, <i>fallentis semita vit&aelig;</i>, was
not to be yours.&nbsp; Fate otherwise decreed it.&nbsp; The touch
of a lettered society, the strife with the Kirk, discontent with
the State, poverty and pride, neglect and success, were needed to
make your Genius what it was, and to endow the world with
&ldquo;Tam o&rsquo; Shanter,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Jolly
Beggars,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Holy Willie&rsquo;s
Prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can praise them too highly&mdash;who
admire in them too much the humour, the scorn, the wisdom, the
unsurpassed energy and courage?&nbsp; So powerful, so commanding,
is the movement of that Beggars&rsquo; Chorus, that, methinks, it
unconsciously echoed in the brain of our greatest living poet
when he conceived the &ldquo;Vision of Sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
shall judge for yourself.&nbsp; Recall:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s to budgets, bags, and wallets!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s to all the wandering train!<br />
Here&rsquo;s our ragged bairns and callets!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One and all cry out, Amen!</p>
<p>A fig for those by law protected!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberty&rsquo;s a glorious feast!<br />
Courts for cowards were erected!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Churches built to please the priest!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drink to lofty hopes that cool&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Visions of a perfect state:<br />
Drink we, last, the public fool,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frantic love and frantic hate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Drink to Fortune, drink to Chance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While we keep a little breath!<br />
Drink to heavy Ignorance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hob and nob with brother Death!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is not the movement the same, though the modern speaks a
wilder recklessness?</p>
<p>So in the best company we leave you, who were the life and
soul of so much company, good and bad.&nbsp; No poet, since the
Psalmist of Israel, ever gave the world more assurance of a man;
none lived a life more strenuous, engaged in an eternal conflict
of the passions, and by them overcome&mdash;&ldquo;mighty and
mightily fallen.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we think of you, Byron seems,
as Plato would have said, remote by one degree from actual truth,
and Musset by a degree more remote than Byron.</p>

Hunt<br />
Enraged you once by writing <i>My dear Byron</i>?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Books have their fates,&mdash;as mortals have who
punt,<br />
And <i>yours</i> have entered on an age of iron.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Critics there be who think your satire blunt,<br />
Your pathos, fudge; such perils must environ<br />
Poets who in their time were quite the rage,<br />
Though now there&rsquo;s not a soul to turn their page.<br />
Yes, there is much dispute about your worth,<br />
And much is said which you might like to know<br />
By modern poets here upon the earth,<br />
Where poets live, and love each other so;<br />
And, in Elysium, it may move your mirth<br />
To hear of bards that pitch your praises low,<br />
Though there be some that for your credit stickle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As&mdash;Glorious Mat,&mdash;and not inglorious
Nichol.</p>
<p class="poetry">(This kind of writing is my pet aversion,<br />
I hate the slang, I hate the personalities,<br />
I loathe the aimless, reckless, loose dispersion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of every rhyme that in the singer&rsquo;s wallet
is,<br />
I hate it as you hated the <i>Excursion</i>,<br />
But, while no man a hero to his valet is,<br />
The hero&rsquo;s still the model; I indite<br />
The kind of rhymes that Byron oft would write.)</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s a Swiss critic whom I cannot
rhyme to,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One Scherer, dry as sawdust, grim and prim.<br />
Of him there&rsquo;s much to say, if I had time to<br />
Concern myself in any wise with <i>him</i>.<br />
He seems to hate the heights he cannot climb to,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He thinks your poetry a coxcomb&rsquo;s whim,<br />
A good deal of his sawdust he has spilt on<br />
Shakespeare, and Moli&egrave;re, and you, and Milton.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ay, much his temper is like Vivien&rsquo;s
mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which found not Galahad pure, nor Lancelot brave;<br
/>
Cold as a hailstorm on an April wood,<br />
He buries poets in an icy grave,<br />
His Essays&mdash;he of the Genevan hood!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing so fine, but better doth he crave.<br />
So stupid and so solemn in his spite<br />
He dares to print that Moli&egrave;re could not write!</p>
<p class="poetry">Enough of these excursions; I was saying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That half our English Bards are turned Reviewers,<br
/>
And Arnold was discussing and assaying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight and value of that work of yours,<br />
Examining and testing it and weighing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And proved, the gems are pure, the gold endures.<br
/>
While Swinburne cries with an exceeding joy,<br />
The stones are paste, and half the gold, alloy.</p>
<p class="poetry">In Byron, Arnold finds the greatest force,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poetic, in this later age of ours;<br />
His song, a torrent from a mountain source,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear as the crystal, singing with the showers,<br
/>
Sweeps to the sea in unrestricted course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through banks o&rsquo;erhung with rocks and sweet
with flowers;<br />
None of your brooks that modestly meander,<br />
But swift as Awe along the Pass of Brander.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when our century has clomb its crest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And backward gazes o&rsquo;er the plains of Time,<br
/>
And counts its harvest, yours is still the best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The richest garner in the field of rhyme<br />
(The metaphoric mixture, &rsquo;tis comfest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is all my own, and is not quite sublime).<br />
But fame&rsquo;s not yours alone; you must divide all<br />
The plums and pudding with the Bard of Rydal!</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span> and <span
class="smcap">Byron</span>, these the lordly names<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And these the gods to whom most incense burns.<br />
&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; cries Swinburne, and in anger flames,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in an &AElig;schylean fury spurns<br />
With impious foot your altar, and exclaims<br />
And wreathes his laurels on the golden urns<br />
Where Coleridge&rsquo;s and Shelley&rsquo;s ashes lie,<br />
Deaf to the din and heedless of the cry.</p>
<p class="poetry">For Byron (Swinburne shouts) has never woven<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One honest thread of life within his song;<br />
As Offenbach is to divine Beethoven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So Byron is to Shelley (<i>This</i> is strong!),<br
/>
And on Parnassus&rsquo; peak, divinely cloven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He may not stand, or stands by cruel wrong;<br />
For Byron&rsquo;s rank (the examiner has reckoned)<br />
Is in the third class or a feeble second.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;A Bernesque poet&rdquo; at the very
most,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &ldquo;never earnest save in politics,&rdquo;<br
/>
The Pegasus that he was wont to boast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A blundering, floundering hackney, full of
tricks,<br />
A beast that must be driven to the post<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By whips and spurs and oaths and kicks and
sticks,<br />
A gasping, ranting, broken-winded brute,<br />
That any judge of Pegasi would shoot;</p>
<p class="poetry">In sooth, a half-bred Pegasus, and far gone<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In spavin, curb, and half a hundred woes.<br />
And Byron&rsquo;s style is &ldquo;jolter-headed jargon;&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His verse is &ldquo;only bearable in
prose.&rdquo;<br />
So living poets write of those that <i>are</i> gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er the Eagle thus the Bantam crows;<br
/>
And Swinburne ends where Verisopht began,<br />
By owning you &ldquo;a very clever man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Or rather does not end: he still must utter<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A quantity of the unkindest things.<br />
Ah! were you here, I marvel, would you flutter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er such a foe the tempest of your wings?<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis &ldquo;rant and cant and glare and splash and
splutter&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That rend the modest air when Byron sings.<br />
There Swinburne stops: a critic rather fiery.<br />
<i>Animis c&aelig;lestibus tant&aelig;ne ir&aelig;</i>?</p>
<p class="poetry">But whether he or Arnold in the right is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long is the argument, the quarrel long;<br />
<i>Non nobis est</i> to settle <i>tantas lites</i>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No poet I, to judge of right or wrong:<br />
But of all things I always think a fight is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>most</i> unpleasant in the lists of song;<br
/>
When Marsyas of old was flayed, Apollo<br />
Set an example which we need not follow.</p>
<p class="poetry">The fashion changes!&nbsp; Maidens do not
wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As once they wore, in necklaces and lockets<br />
A curl ambrosial of Lord Byron&rsquo;s hair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don Juan&rdquo; is not always in our
pockets&mdash;<br />
Nay, a New Writer&rsquo;s readers do not care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much for your verse, but are inclined to mock its<br
/>
Manners and morals.&nbsp; Ay, and most young ladies<br />
To yours prefer the &ldquo;Epic&rdquo; called &ldquo;of
Hades&rdquo;!</p>
<p class="poetry">I do not blame them; I&rsquo;m inclined to
think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That with the reigning taste &rsquo;tis vain to
quarrel,<br />
And Burns might teach his votaries to drink,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Byron never meant to make them moral.<br />
You yet have lovers true, who will not shrink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From lauding you and giving you the laurel;<br />
The Germans too, those men of blood and iron,<br />
Of all our poets chiefly swear by Byron.</p>
<p class="poetry">Farewell, thou Titan fairer than the Gods!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Farewell, farewell, thou swift and lovely spirit,<br

Thou splendid warrior with the world at odds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unpraised, unpraisable, beyond thy merit;<br />
Chased, like Orestes, by the Furies&rsquo; rods,<br />

223</span>XXII.<br />
<i>To Q. Horatius Flaccus</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> what manner of Paradise are we
to conceive that you, Horace, are dwelling, or what region of
immortality can give you such pleasures as this life
afforded?&nbsp; The country and the town, nature and men, who
knew them so well as you, or who ever so wisely made the best of
those two worlds?&nbsp; Truly here you had good things, nor do
you ever, in all your poems, look for more delight in the life
beyond; you never expect consolation for present sorrow, and when
you once have shaken hands with a friend the parting seems to you
eternal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus<br />
Tam cari capitis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you sing, for the dear head you mourn has sunk, for ever,
beneath the wave.&nbsp; Virgil might wander forth bearing the
golden branch &ldquo;the Sibyl doth to singing men allow,&rdquo;
and might visit, as one not wholly without hope, the dim
dwellings of the dead and the unborn.&nbsp; To him was it
permitted to see and sing &ldquo;mothers and men, and the bodies
outworn of mighty heroes, boys and unwedded maids, and young men
borne to the funeral fire before their parent&rsquo;s
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The endless caravan swept past
him&mdash;&ldquo;many as fluttering leaves that drop and fall in
autumn woods when the first frost begins; many as birds that
flock landward from the great sea when now the chill year drives
them o&rsquo;er the deep and leads them to sunnier
lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such things was it given to the sacred poet
to behold, and &ldquo;the happy seats and sweet pleasances of
fortunate souls, where the larger light clothes all the plains
and dips them in a rosier gleam, plains with their own new sun
and stars before unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, not <i>frustra
pius</i> was Virgil, as you say, Horace, in your melancholy
song.&nbsp; In him, we fancy, there was a happier mood than your
melancholy patience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not, though thou wert sweeter
of song than Thracian Orpheus, with that lyre whose lay led the
dancing trees, not so would the blood return to the empty shade
of him whom once with dread wand, the inexorable God hath folded
with his shadowy flocks; but patience lighteneth what heaven
forbids us to undo.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Durum, sed levius fit patietia!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was all your philosophy in that last sad resort to which we
are pushed so often&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With close-lipped Patience for our only
friend,<br />
Sad Patience, too near neighbour of Despair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Epicurean is at one with the Stoic at last, and Horace
with Marcus Aurelius.&nbsp; &ldquo;To go away from among men, if
there are Gods, is not a thing to be afraid of; but if indeed
they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human
affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or
devoid of providence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An excellent philosophy, but easier to those for whom no Hope
had dawned or seemed to set.&nbsp; Yes! it is harder than common,
Horace, for us to think of <i>you</i>, still glad somewhere,
among rivers like Liris and plains and vine-clad hills, that</p>
<blockquote><p>Solemque suum, sua sidera norunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard, for you looked for no such thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Omnes una
manet nox</i><br />
<i>Et calcanda semel via leti</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could not tell M&aelig;cenas that you would meet him
again; you could only promise to tread the dark path with
him.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ibimus</i>,
<i>ibimus</i>,<br />
<i>Utcunque pr&aelig;cedes</i>, <i>supremum</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Carpere iter comites
parati</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enough, Horace, of these mortuary musings.&nbsp; You loved the
lesson of the roses, and now and again would speak somewhat like
a death&rsquo;s head over your temperate cups of Sabine
<i>ordinaire</i>.&nbsp; Your melancholy moral was but meant to
heighten the joy of your pleasant life, when wearied Italy, after
all her wars and civic bloodshed, had won a peaceful haven.&nbsp;
The harbour might be treacherous; the prince might turn to the
tyrant; far away on the wide Roman marches might be heard, as it
were, the endless, ceaseless monotone of beating horses&rsquo;
hoofs and marching feet of men.&nbsp; They were coming, they were
nearing, like footsteps heard on wool; there was a sound of
multitudes and millions of barbarians, all the North, <i>officina
gentium</i>, mustering and marshalling her peoples.&nbsp; But
their coming was not to be to-day, nor to-morrow, nor to-day was
the budding Empire to blossom into the blood-red flower of
Nero.&nbsp; In the lull between the two tempests of Republic and
Empire your odes sound &ldquo;like linnets in the pauses of the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What joy there is in these songs! what delight of life, what
an exquisite Hellenic grace of art, what a manly nature to
endure, what tenderness and constancy of friendship, what a sense
of all that is fair in the glittering stream, the music of the
waterfall, the hum of bees, the silvery grey of the olive woods
on the hillside!&nbsp; How human are all your verses, Horace!
what a pleasure is yours in the straining poplars, swaying in the
wind! what gladness you gain from the white crest of Soracte,
beheld through the fluttering snowflakes while the logs are being
piled higher on the hearth.&nbsp; You sing of women and
wine&mdash;not all wholehearted in your praise of them, perhaps,
for passion frightens you, and &rsquo;tis pleasure more than love
that you commend to the young.&nbsp; Lydia and Glycera, and the
others, are but passing guests of a heart at ease in itself, and
happy enough when their facile reign is ended.&nbsp; You seem to
me like a man who welcomes middle age, and is more glad than
Sophocles was to &ldquo;flee from these hard masters&rdquo; the
passions.&nbsp; In the fallow leisure of life you glance round
contented, and find all very good save the need to leave all
behind.&nbsp; Even that you take with an Italian good-humour, as
the folk of your sunny country bear poverty and hunger.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Durum</i>, <i>sed levius fit patientia</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To them, to you, the loveliness of your land is, and was, a
thing to live for.&nbsp; None of the Latin poets your fellows, or
none but Virgil, seem to me to have known so well as you, Horace,
how happy and fortunate a thing it was to be born in Italy.&nbsp;
You do not say so, like your Virgil, in one splendid passage,
numbering the glories of the land as a lover might count the
perfections of his mistress.&nbsp; But the sentiment is ever in
your heart and often on your lips.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me nec tam patiens
Laced&aelig;mon,<br />
Nec tam Lariss&aelig; percussit campus opim&aelig;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quam domus Albune&aelig; resonantis<br />
Et pr&aelig;ceps Anio, ac Tiburni lucus, et uda<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobilibus pomaria rivis. <a
name="citation229"></a><a href="#footnote229"
class="citation">[229]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a poet should speak, and to every singer his own land
should be dearest.&nbsp; Beautiful is Italy with the grave and
delicate outlines of her sacred hills, her dark groves, her
little cities perched like eyries on the crags, her rivers
gliding under ancient walls; beautiful is Italy, her seas, and
her suns: but dearer to me the long grey wave that bites the rock
below the minster in the north; dearer are the barren moor and
black peat-water swirling in tauny foam, and the scent of bog
myrtle and the bloom of heather, and, watching over the lochs,
the green round-shouldered hills.</p>
<p>In affection for your native land, Horace, certainly the pride
in great Romans dead and gone made part, and you were, in all
senses, a lover of your country, your country&rsquo;s heroes,
your country&rsquo;s gods.&nbsp; None but a patriot could have
sung that ode on Regulus, who died, as our own hero died on an
evil day, for the honour of Rome, as Gordon for the honour of
England.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fertur pudic&aelig; conjugis osculum,<br />
Parvosque natos, ut capitis minor,<br />

<p>We talk of the Greeks as your teachers.&nbsp; Your teachers
they were, but that poem could only have been written by a
Roman!&nbsp; The strength, the tenderness, the noble and
monumental resolution and resignation&mdash;these are the gifts
of the lords of human things, the masters of the world.</p>
<p>Your country&rsquo;s heroes are dear to you, Horace, but you
did not sing them better than your country&rsquo;s Gods, the
pious protecting spirits of the hearth, the farm, the field;
kindly ghosts, it may be, of Latin fathers dead or Gods framed in
the image of these.&nbsp; What you actually believed we know not,
<i>you</i> knew not.&nbsp; Who knows what he believes?&nbsp;
<i>Parcus Deorum cultor</i> you bowed not often, it may be, in
the temples of the state religion and before the statues of the
great Olympians; but the pure and pious worship of rustic
tradition, the faith handed down by the homely elders, with
<i>that</i> you never broke.&nbsp; Clean hands and a pure heart,
these, with a sacred cake and shining grains of salt, you could
offer to the Lares.&nbsp; It was a benignant religion, uniting
old times and new, men living and men long dead and gone, in a
kind of service and sacrifice solemn yet familiar.</p>

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
